  "description": "By &quot;Social Proof&quot; I mean some validation that the sender is a genuine human. Not spam, drip-campaign, mass marketing, etc.<p>Examples in social media:<p>- Twitter: When reaching out via twitter, you have followers. Which embeds a certain amount of social trust. i.e. &quot;if other people like this person, they can't be that bad&quot;<p>- LinkedIn: Similar to twitter. But less validation, since you can just request connections to reach that 500+ number.<p>- Discord/Slack: Invite system. At some point someone in the community invited the member. So there has been some level of validation.<p>- Keybase: Requires setting up a Public/Private key pair. Demonstrates basic level of competency.<p>Question inspired by spending the last 6 months doing email marketing. It's not great. But it's the one direct line of communication that everyone has.",
