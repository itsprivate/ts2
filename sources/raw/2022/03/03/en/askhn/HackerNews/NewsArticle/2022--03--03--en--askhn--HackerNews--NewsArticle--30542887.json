  "description": "I’m a dev with 10 years of experience, I’ve mostly used aws services in the past so I kind of understand their authentication models pretty well. I feel like they did the customer centric thing and really dumbed them down. They’re just pretty straightforward to use.<p>Permissions in GCP seem like a mess, I’m trying to use python to get credentials and there is a whole python library for authentication and getting credentials (google-auth).<p>There’s also not a uniform page for every service where I can go understand authentication/permissions.<p>They do have a ton of docs, but it’s kind like a document dump.<p>Sorry for the rant! I want to know if it’s just me and whether I’m missing something!",
