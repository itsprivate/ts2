  "description": "Hi HN,<p>We've just released the first open-source version of our model serving tool Inferrd. Our goal is making model deployment a breeze with:<p>•Maintenance-free environments. Just drag and drop your models, and get an API.<p>•Your data staying in your cloud. Have full control over where you send your data, and how it's processed.<p>•No more security compliance process to go through as Inferrd is self-hosted.<p>•No more pricing indexed on volume, as cloud-based solutions offer.<p>You can host Inferrd on your own cloud at github.com/inferrd or check out our managed version at Inferrd.com<p>This is the first version supporting SciKit, TensorFlow and ONNX. We're super eager for feedback to improve it and start serving more framework with more advanced features !",
