  "description": "Hello everyone,<p>Iâ€™m helping a university in Barcelona which is looking to place 37 Ukrainian students in internships.<p>We are going to provide SDR and growth marketing training through a partner, but I am looking for companies in need of SDRs and growth marketers.<p>These students will be trained and ready to contribute from day 1.<p>Ideally, this is a 6-month, paid internship which could lead to a full-time position.\nWe will handle the admin stuff to ease international hiring.<p>If you or someone you know could be interested, please DM, send me an email at pablo@inteliom.app or connect with me on LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com/in/pablomacias).<p>Looking forward to hearing from you!",
