  "description": "Intro Iâ€™ve had a good career so far. I began working full-time as a programmer in 2008. At that time my title was Junior Developer. I had a decent boss and cool co-workers, and I cut my teeth on Java and .NET. It was a good experience. After 2 years at that gig, I felt that it was time to move on.\nI contacted recruiters, and one eventually found me a promotion: Systems Analyst.",
