  "description": "What do you value the most in a romantic partner?<p>I'm currently in a situation where I have 2 people in my life:<p>A long-term partner that I've been with for almost 5 years(last 2 years open relationship). They are super fun and chill and make me feel good, but their irresponsibility is driving me nuts and I cannot imagine them being like this once we have kids. They have almost no goals and give up on things easily.<p>My new partner is a medical doctor. We hang out pretty much all the time and are able to talk about intellectual and spiritual things and I can definitely imagine having an &quot;adult life&quot; with them, but they are a bit too serious and lack fun.<p>The reason I'm asking here on HN and not Reddit/Quora is that the majority of HN readers are probably, personality-wise, a bit like me: most likely introverted, pragmatically-thinking nerds that I can mostly relate to.<p>Also, sorry for my bad English, it's not my first language.",
