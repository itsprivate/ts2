  "description": "Link: https://prodscape.net<p>-----<p>Hello HN,<p>Long-time lurker, first-time poster. I've created a service that creates a &quot;flow map&quot; of your mobile app.<p>The goal is to reduce last-minute regressions, promote holistic discussion, and help develop more ownership within an organization. This is something that I would have liked to have had when I was working at a big company.<p>Some caveats:<p><pre><code>  * Only iOS is currently supported but Android-support will be coming soon.\n  * You need a developer-signed IPA file (see the guide on creating an IPA file here: https://prodscape.net/finding-ipa.html).\n</code></pre>\nI would appreciate your thoughts on:<p><pre><code>  1.) your barriers to trying it\n  2.) your impressions of the map\n  3.) whether you're interested in applying this within your team\n  4.) anything else.\n</code></pre>\n<i>Don't have access to an IPA file?</i> Email me at illahi@prodscape.net and I will send you one to try.<p>Thanks!",
