  "description": "We all oscillate in productivity. I've noticed this in myself and in others. The less productive we are, the more technical updates we give in standup.<p>My standup updates will be very high level when I am feeling in the flow. When I feel slow or stuck I will give much more detailed updates. I think this may be related to feeling a need to justify lower productivity.<p>Have you noticed this in your teams?",
