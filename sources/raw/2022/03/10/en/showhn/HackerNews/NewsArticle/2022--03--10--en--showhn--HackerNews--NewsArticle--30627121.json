  "description": "Parsers VC collects data on startups, investors, and venture capital firms in real time. The databases are updated every 24 hours. \nIt's very simple: Parsers VC installs its trackers on the venture capital funds' websites (namely the startup, team, and news sections) and automatically collects all updates. The data is also obtained from social networks and news sites. Thus, there is no need to wait for the startup or venture capital firm itself to update the information on the aggregator site, all updates appear by themselves.\nYou can see examples of the data here: <a href=\"https://parsers.vc/about/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://parsers.vc/about/</a>",
