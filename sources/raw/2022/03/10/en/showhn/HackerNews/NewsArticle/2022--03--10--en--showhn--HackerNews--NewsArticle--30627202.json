  "description": "Dockerized is like npx for unix tools: Run popular cli tools without installation.<p>Example:<p><pre><code>    dockerized npm init\n    dockerized python2 somescript.py\n</code></pre>\nRun an older version of a tool:<p><pre><code>    NODE_VERSION=15.0 dockerized node\n</code></pre>\nUse cases:<p>- Maintaining multiple versions of an app<p>- Installing without polluting host machine<p>- Quickly run some commands you may not have installed<p>Features:<p>- intuitive use. Just the original command, but with 'dockerized' in front.<p>- dockerized apps can access the current directory and read/modify files, just like native apps.<p>- no need to know which docker image this package comes from.<p>- support for tools which don't have an official docker image.<p>- container cleaned up after use.<p>- ability to specify the version.<p>- version specification per directory (share exact versions with your team mates).<p>The inner workings are pretty simple, it's just a docker-compose file.<p>As expected with dockerization, there are limitations related to networking, and file persistence (outside current dir), but it can make life easy for simple scenarios.<p>Pull requests welcome!",
