  "description": "# *Weâ€™re building [Curacel](<a href=\"https://curacel.co\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://curacel.co</a>) - API to embed insurance into any business in Africa*<p>---<p>At Curacel, our goal is to make it easy and pleasant to get &amp; use insurance in emerging markets.<p>We are building the rails to make insurance work for the next billion Africans.<p>---<p># *Problem*<p>Selling insurance in Africa is still offline and manual, insurers need to integrate with online distribution partners for more reach. Every insurer needs to build the same integrations with every distribution partner, having each one of them do it makes it expensive and time consuming for both parties, ultimately making insurance more expensive and out of reach for middle-class, price-sensitive Africans.<p>---<p># *Solution*<p>We enable *tech companies to sell &amp; process insurance across Africa*<p>With our API any company can display a real time insurance quote on their product and complete a purchase without leaving the app. With 1 API any company can add any insurance to their product across all 54 countries in Africa and soon across LatAm and Asia.<p>![Screen Shot 2022-03-10 at 1.47.05 PM.png](<a href=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/c4d5157f-a8aa-4196-901a-31d2dfa52693/Screen_Shot_2022-03-10_at_1.47.05_PM.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/...</a>)<p>We are working with YC companies like Flutterwave, PayHippo, Float, Send, Topship etc.<p>---<p># *Ask*<p>- Contact us if you wants to offer insurance in your product.\n- Intros to digital businesses (Travel booking,Logistics, E-commerce) who can embed insurance in their service<p>Reach Us at founders@curacel.co",
