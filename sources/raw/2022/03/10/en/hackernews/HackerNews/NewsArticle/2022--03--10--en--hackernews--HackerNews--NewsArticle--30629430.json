  "description": "I came across a word in the Postgres source code that I'd never seen before: &quot;frammish&quot;.<p><a href=\"https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/storage/lmgr/lwlock.c\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend...</a> :<p>&gt; Therefore, they offer both exclusive and shared lock modes (to support read/write and read-only access to a shared object).  There are few other frammishes.  User-level locking should be done with the full lock manager --- which depends on LWLocks to protect its shared state.<p>It sort of makes sense in context, as a &quot;feature&quot; or a &quot;flourish&quot;. It also appears on the pg_hackers mailing list:<p>&gt; There has been some talk of separating the power to create new users from the power of being superuser (although presumably only a superuser should be allowed to create new superusers).  If the planned pg_role rewrite gets submitted before the 8.1 feature freeze, I might look at adding that frammish into it.<p>and here, from 19 years ago:<p>&gt; And we get ragged on regularly for the non-SQL-standard features we've inherited from Berkeley Postgres (eg, the implicit-FROM frammish that was under discussion yesterday).<p>No amount of googling turns up a formal definition or usage outside of the Postgres community. &quot;frammish.org&quot; doesn't seem to be related.<p>Are Postgres developers starting to evolve their own dialect? Should we call an anthropologist?",
