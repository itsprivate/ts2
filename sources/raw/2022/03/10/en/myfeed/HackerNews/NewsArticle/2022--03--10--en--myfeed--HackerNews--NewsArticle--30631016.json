  "description": "presuming that you have on the table two offers: one for fullstack .net (C# + angular, react or blazor) and one for ios developer.\nthe interesting part is that both are almost identical (salary, office, benefits etc.)<p>an advice will be very welcome - what will you choose and why?<p>p.s. my background is mostly backend in golang (so the technology switch should be done anyway). and yes - I googled it but decided to ask here so that search engines bubble filters can be excluded..<p>p.s.s. I'm fine with both ones (maybe a little more inclined to choose ios). But interested also in your opinion about eventual perspective (looking into the future) related to chosen path.",
