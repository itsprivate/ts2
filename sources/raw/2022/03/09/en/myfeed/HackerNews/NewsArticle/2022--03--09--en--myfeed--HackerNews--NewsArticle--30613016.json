  "description": "Suhail Ahmad Khan a writer and poet, Suhail hails from the Lar tehsil of Central Kashmir's Ganderbal. Born on  May 6th of the year 2002, Suhail has been a student of Crescent Classes and presently is a Dental Surgery Bachelor (BDS) at GDC Srinagar.\nSuhail has had a childhood affinity towards Sufi ideas and shrines. Relatably, Suhail's writings and poetic works revolve around and encompass Sufi notions and culture. Suhail also fans the season of autumn, with the season's transformational events finding a metaphorical presence in His works. Suhail, more properly 'Suhail Ahmad Khan', uses 'Bazm(بزم)' as His pen-name(تخلص).",
