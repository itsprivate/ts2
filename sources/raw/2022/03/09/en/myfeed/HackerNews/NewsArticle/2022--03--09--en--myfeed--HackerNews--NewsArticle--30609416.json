  "description": "The war minus the human pain and suffering is like watching a live chess match. Main players being what I mentioned in the title and then rest of the world on standby with &quot; cleverly worded press conferences&quot;. What I can't figure out are;<p>1)How is Ukraine (inspiring) able to fight Russia - superpower and hangon for this long?<p>2)How are they  able to predict and shoot down Russian jets with precision ? Unless it is us haha fighting on their behalf and with the jets painted with  Ukrainian flags? I know... It's crazy thought but..<p>3)And why would the president of Belarus whom aligns with Russia make a &quot;supposedly mistake as he briefed his generals&quot;about the next country for invasion - Moldova should Russia win the battle?<p>The question is who makes a serious mistake at a time like this when they trying to win? Nobody. So why?<p>One of the rules of chess is to attack the king by focusing on his escape squares and Ukraine is doing it well unless ahemmm...........<p>Am I making sense or am I a crazy woman? Thanks for answering and please have a good rest of our week.",
