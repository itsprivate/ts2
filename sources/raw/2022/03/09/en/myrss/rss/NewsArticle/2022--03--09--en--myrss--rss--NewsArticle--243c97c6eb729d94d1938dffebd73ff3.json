  "description": "Background I’m going to discuss an important topic that affects everybody in tech: diversity.\nNo, this won’t be some preachy post about how diversity is great and how you should be a better human being. Rather, I’m going to tell you about the things I’ve experienced working on diversity – particularly the interesting events of the last few days that happened internally at Stack Overflow.\nIt’s no secret that the tech industry is not that diverse.",
