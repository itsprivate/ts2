  "description": "I'm looking for text books about data structures and algorithms (preferably using C language). I particularly like old text books. Purpose of this is to practice implementing data structures like priority queues, balanced binary trees from scratch. Some of the data structures I'm especially interested in are binary heaps, priority queues, balanced binary trees, quad trees. Thanks!",
