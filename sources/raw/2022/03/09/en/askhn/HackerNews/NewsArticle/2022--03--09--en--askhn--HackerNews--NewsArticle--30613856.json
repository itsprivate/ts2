  "description": "I'm pretty thoroughly burned out. I've been a cog in a very broken machine for too long, but I stayed because I love the people and was a highly motivated useful idiot.<p>Now that I've managed to get myself ready to be on the market, what should I be looking for in a new job such that it won't inhibit recovery (and perhaps aid in it)?<p>Some thoughts I've had:\n* Take a long break instead (which I don't really want to do because, you know, bills etc, but I also wonder how much it might impact ability to reenter the market)\n* Try to be somewhere with more autonomy\n* Go with a smaller place to perhaps have a better chance at achieving the above\n* Emphasize work-life balance (but figure out what they actually mean by that)",
