  "description": "Hi friends, I'm wondering if there is a service (paid or free) that one can easily search through the major newspapers based on criterions.<p>For example, let's say I want to search all English newspaper in Germany (if there is any) for any news piece that contains &quot;Ukraine&quot; and &quot;NATO&quot;, between year 2006 and 2022, what options do I have? I do not live in German btw if it's useful.",
