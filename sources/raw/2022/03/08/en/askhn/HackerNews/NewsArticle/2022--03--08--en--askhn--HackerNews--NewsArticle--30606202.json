  "description": "I'm not an expert in USB3 implementation details, but it seems to be a nightmare, even if you can afford to buy the spec. Meanwhile, power-over-ethernet has existed for a while. It seems like all we would need is slightly different connectors to fit into slim devices like phones, and PoE capable cables could fill the data-and-charging roles of USB3, with less weird proprietary nonsense, almost none except for the connector itself, which could conceivably (definitely in my fantasy world) be an open-source design. The software and most of the other hardware pretty much already exists, right? Connecting your phone to your computer is just networking, like plugging in an Ethernet adapter.<p>I'm sure it can't actually be as simple as just CADing up some new connectors, but is there a reason besides inertia this couldn't be done and be effective? Say, by a startup willing to abandon a bit of precedent to get a less-proprietary connector?",
