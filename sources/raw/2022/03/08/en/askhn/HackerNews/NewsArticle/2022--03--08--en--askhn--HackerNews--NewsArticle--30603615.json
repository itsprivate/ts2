  "description": "There is a relatively cleaver phishing scam that's active right now where the site only shows the phishing scam when it's visited by a smart phone. Visiting it from a regular desktop browser redirects to some other service. (can still be seen using dev tools)<p>A cursory investigation showed that Namecheap is providing both registrar and hosting services for this phishing site. I reported the offending site to namecheap but they have refused to act, likely because they haven't been able to trigger the scam.<p>What should I do? How do I get the attention of the security team at namecheap?<p>Since this is a throwaway account, I'm afraid I might trigger some spam protection if I share this url in the OP. I'll share it in the comments once this post gets some engagement.<p>IF YOU CAN HELP PLEASE DO. I only managed to stop one of my family members from falling victem to this scam by accident. I'm sure many have not been as lucky.<p>Thank you.",
