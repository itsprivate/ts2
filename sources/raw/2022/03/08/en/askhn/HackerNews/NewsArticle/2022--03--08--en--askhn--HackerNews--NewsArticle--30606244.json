  "description": "I'd like to create a GUI utility to work with ID3 tags on mp3 files. I was looking for options and found out that programming for Windows is a daunting experience.<p>I can recall starting programming using Visual Basic a long, long time ago. By then I found it very easy to start with because of the drag-&amp;-drop nature of the GUI, out-of-the-box events, etc.<p>What are some modern, free alternatives to Visual Basic that would allow me to easily create a GUI and attach scripts and events to its controls?<p>Please excuse my dated references, I am a web developer unfamiliar with programming for the desktop",
