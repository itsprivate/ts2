  "description": "A little background: Self-taught web developer, hired to work with both frontend and backend code. This is my first software development job.<p>My problem is, I'm slow to pick the technologies needed to start working on JIRA tickets. I'm working together with another junior developer (also self-taught, started same day with me) but I'm just stuck eating his dust. I decided to put egos aside and ask him for help and the only thing I got was generic advice, which I already do (read the docs, understand what you read, try building their tutorials/getting started section, read more code, trial and error).<p>Either I'm inherently slow and it's time to accept the natural limits of my brain or there's a better method that would work for me and I'm missing it.",
