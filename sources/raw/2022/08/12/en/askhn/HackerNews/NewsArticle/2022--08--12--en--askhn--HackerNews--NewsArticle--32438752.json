  "description": "Hello!<p>I've been using NordPass recently, but the interface is pretty broken with modern password flows (e.g. you enter your username, the webapp moves to the next &quot;page&quot; and gets your password. ADP does this, for example). NordPass guesses things are a new password on an established site about 20-30% of the time. Sort of annoying UX, though I dont really have any other complaints.<p>As a community, what do you recommend? I _think_ I've seen bitwarden recommended, but would love hear opinions on current state-of-the-art and recommendations.",
