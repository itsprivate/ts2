  "description": "I feel I've reached peak account registration on the web. Not a week goes by where I don't have to register for some service, and they're all starting to get out of hand. Luckily I have a password manager to organize them all, but I've reached that threshold of 'too many' now and I was wondering how often you people register for new accounts.<p>My last account I registered was for Notion, since I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. But every week some new service pops up which is apparently much better and will help you get things faster and more efficiently. But when does it stop? Is there a point, where as netizens we need to stop registering and just rest on our laurels for a bit?",
