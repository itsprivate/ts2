  "description": "I'm seeing a lot of opinions recently on HN about sunscreen, so I'm looking to poll the community on the topic.<p>For context - I'm living in socal, I'm cycling 70-100 miles for at least one day, 20-40 other days with at least one rest day, and some days past 12PM (70-100 mile days).<p>For those who are in the sun for extended periods - are you wearing sunscreen? If so, what are you using? If not, any helpful strategies? Thanks everyone for your advice.",
