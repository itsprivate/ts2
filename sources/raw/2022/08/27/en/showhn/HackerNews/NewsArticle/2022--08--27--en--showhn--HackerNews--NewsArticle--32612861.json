  "description": "First, I'm by no mean a programmer.\nSecond, I am reading HN for years, just registered to make this public and see if it can be useful for someone. I have nothing to gain monetary.<p>A while ago, I decided that no blogging system was simple enough and I looked for a small wiki to use as a CMS/blog. Found WikWiki on C2.com and I mixed it with some basic Markdown syntax, a minimal template and added password protection.<p>The result is a single php file, no database and no dependencies. Code is a mess, not modulable, probably wrong in so many ways, but it can probably used by some as personal notepad, wiki, CMS, blog, etc.<p>Any comments appreciated.",
