  "description": "I started listening the five hours (!) interview of John Carmack on Lex fridman's podcast, and he was talking about, among other things, about the fact that he's coding since he was a kid and spent hours upon hours in front of a screen and keyboard writing code. I find Carmack's, Romero's and the Id software folks work very fascinating and at some point i would like to dive more in depth on the history of their work and analyze their code to learn hopefully new things.<p>But that interview also strucked something that i'm battling with myself. I'm 23 and I spent my entire childhood wasting my time on Social media, World Of Warcraft, and other pointless stuff. Literally 10-14 hours a day. I don't regret my gaming interests, but i do regret the fact that i wasted so much of my life on games like World of Warcraft (I started playing when i was 10 years old) instead of finding and developing my future interests and «passions». I've always knew i wanted to study Computer Science but due to my life circumstances(mental health problems, serious financial hardships, etc.)  i sacrificed a lot to get into university which i did and i hope i can finish it.<p>Over the last couple years i started thinking, how would my life be if i spent that time coding/reverse engineering/learning the internals of OS, reading books, or generally developing my interests instead of playing wow and mindlessly scrolling on SM? Would i still be in the same position in my life, the same person, as i am now? Honestly i can only guess but i don't know how to handle that i lost so much viable time. Time which could had invested on my future and develop my skills as a computer scientist.",
