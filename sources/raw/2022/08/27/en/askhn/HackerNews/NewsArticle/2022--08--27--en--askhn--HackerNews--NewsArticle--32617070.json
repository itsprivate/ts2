  "description": "A friend of mine (in the UK, but this should be of general interest) is looking for a dual WAN router  to make the best possible use of two DSL/cable connections.<p>Being able to send bind specific clients to each uplink would be useful, but having the ability to load balance across both connections simultaneously on weekends would be welcome.<p>Any recommendations?",
