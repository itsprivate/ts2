  "description": "I’ve so far refused to get a Wi-Fi baby monitor because of all the horror stories I’ve heard of horrendous security practices.  However, our current baby monitor just doesn’t have the range we need when we are outside or in the garage, or at my in-laws’ larger house.<p>Are there any brands of Wi-Fi baby monitors that I can trust to have acceptable security practices?  Yes, it need to be video. I’d prefer an actual baby monitor camera and not a large ugly security camera.",
