  "description": "tl;dr: Go to kindlehnbeta.pythonanywhere.com on your Kindle’s browser.<p>I wrote a wrapper over hackernews that allows me to browse it on my Kindle. Simply visit kindlehnbeta.pythonanywhere.com on your Kindle’s browser. You’ll be able to view top stories, the comments within them and even the article content that the stories link to. The articles are parsed by a library that makes its best attempt to extract the main content.<p>I only own a Kindle Oasis (10th Generation) and thus have only tested this on it. I’d imagine it looks fine on other Kindles, but you’ll have to tell me.<p>Link to screenshots: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/8kKneH0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://imgur.com/a/8kKneH0</a><p>Really, I made this for myself as a quick solution for a personal need. But it seems like there are a few of you out there that would enjoy this as well. So I am making this public for others to try out. Let me know if this is something you actually want to use. If so, and the reception is positive, then I will continue to build it out to be better and more feature complete. In addition to this, would you enjoy a generic rss feed reader as well? — one that allows you to read any rss feed right from your Kindle’s browser? I can build this if that’s something you guys really want.",
