  "description": "Hi! I'm a DevOps/Sysadmin/whatever from the USA (California). I accidentally got married while on vacation 8 years ago and never really came back.<p>Since I moved, I've only been able to find work about 50% of the time. Getting a work permit in Europe basically isn't possible without a degree.<p>I've been unemployed since Covid began. It was quite humbling going from complaining about  recruiters to spending my days staring blankly at job sites for 10 hours per day.<p>Going back to the USA is out of the question, but nobody in Europe will do a work permit for somebody without a college degree.<p>Finding consulting has proven impossible due to the timezone difference. Upwork and other similar sites are worthless, unless you're a guy with 30 years experience (I am) who is willing to work for $10/hour (I am not).<p>I'm done with working in this part of tech. Which other realms might be more conducive to remote work with minimal interaction? Maybe it's time to give up and become a landlord instead?",
