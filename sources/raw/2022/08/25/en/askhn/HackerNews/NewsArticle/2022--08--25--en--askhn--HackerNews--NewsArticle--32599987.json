  "description": "I've got a lot of audio files I want to make available (all created by me) and I'd like to self-host them a la Soundcloud.  Specifically like Soundcloud, in fact - just a bunch of files that are presented with webby player things, optionally with metadata but that's not hugely important.<p>I'm not after any &quot;stream your music collection to XYZ&quot; solutions or anything with authenticated users.  Also ideally it would use a simple server with optionally SQLite for storage - anything with more than two moving parts is too much faff right now.<p>I've looked at the &quot;Awesome Self-Hosted&quot; list on Github but they're pretty much all &quot;stream your media collection&quot; type solutions.  Tried to install Polaris (didn't work) and Rauversion (requires Postgres).",
