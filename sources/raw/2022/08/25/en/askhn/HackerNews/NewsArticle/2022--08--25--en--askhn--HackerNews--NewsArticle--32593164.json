  "description": "I'm normally a very optimistic person, but doing five years of bootstrapped startups and side projects with no major wins feels like I'm a pair of molars being worn away by a habitual teeth grinder. I feel like I've spread myself too thinly across a number of projects (a startup, a newsletter, consulting, another website, writing), but am having difficulties deciding on what to prioritize, what to completely drop, and how to approach deciding it in a structured manner. I think third party advice from a respected mentor can help get me out of the weeds.<p>How would you recommend approaching a mentor for this? Should I reach out via LinkedIn, personal email, or a forum like Reddit/HN? There isn't anyone in my direct network who I think &quot;yeah I'd want to be where they are in 5 years following a similar path&quot;. Should I lead with these issues or keep it more general at first?<p>For reference, I'm the technical cofounder, but with all of the side projects, I've had a couple of years of part-time experience in marketing/growth hacking (ew buzzword, but just think growth with $0 spend) and sales too.",
