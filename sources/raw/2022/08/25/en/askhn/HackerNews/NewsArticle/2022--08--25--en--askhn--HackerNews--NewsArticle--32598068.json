  "description": "When you fork a repository, GitHub won't add any contributions you make to the fork in your contribution matrix. These will be counted only after you create a PR to the original repo and it gets merged!!!<p>Can anybody explain why GitHub works like this and if there's a way to disable it for my forks?<p>I understand that instead of forking through github I could &quot;fork&quot; manually by cloning and changing the origin to my repo, but why not make it easy?",
