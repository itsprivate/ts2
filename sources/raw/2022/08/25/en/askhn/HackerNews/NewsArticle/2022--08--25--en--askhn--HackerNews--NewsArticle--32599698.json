  "description": "Hello everyone,<p>An open source app of mine is being &quot;hijacked&quot; by a contributor, and I have no idea how to handle this the right way.<p>In a span of 6 months, they contributed a lot. During these 6 months, I wasn't careful enough while reviewing their PR (because of personal issues), and they took the initiative to change existing features and made the codebase &quot;messier&quot;.<p>Since then, I started rewriting and cleaning everything, but they keep creating PRs with feature changes, adding features without discussing them beforehand, and it's frustrating, since they are creating multiple PRs a week, with more and more changes.<p>Reviewing their PR is becoming harder and harder, because I feel like I'm wasting my time arguing with them, as we don't have the same &quot;view&quot; of how should the app work.<p>I feel like I can't say no to them (or I don't know how to do so) because I should be grateful as they helped with some bug fixes, yet I feel like I'm loosing my own project.<p>How to handle this (without blocking them) ?",
