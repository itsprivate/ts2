  "description": "I'm worried that we are starting to see the effect of the Akamai takeover. Linode has always been very dependable for us in the past, but this is the third time in the past 6 months that our startup experiences a +30 minute downtime all across the board on all our nodes. This used to be a very rare occurrence in the nearly ten years that we've been with them, but not so anymore apparently.",
