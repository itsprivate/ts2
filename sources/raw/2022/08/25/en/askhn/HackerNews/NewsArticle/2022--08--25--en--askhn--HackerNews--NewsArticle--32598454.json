  "description": "As the quality of Reddit declines, Hacker News becomes more and more interesting as a consistent user-friendly and respectful forum for technology and science.<p>However, a notable difference from Reddit is the absence of the &quot;subreddit&quot; concept.<p>Do you think it would be good for Hacker News to slowly try to fill that niche? It doesn't have to be a free-for-all creation of subforums, personally I believe that manually curated categories would be useful.<p>Has this ever existed on HN?",
