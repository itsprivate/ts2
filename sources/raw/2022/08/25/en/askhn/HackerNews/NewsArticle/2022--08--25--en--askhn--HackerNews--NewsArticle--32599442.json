  "description": "I'm currently enrolled in a MS in Computer Science program and need to come up with a topic for research before I take my thesis credits next semester. We have the option of doing either a project or a thesis, and most of my peers have chosen the project option so I don't have many good examples of successful theses at my institution. I would like to apply for a PhD program in the future so looking at doing original research and a thesis.<p>For those of you who have written a thesis, how did you select your topic? Were you able to parlay your MS research into successful placement in a PhD program? Any advice on how to find a research topic within a larger domain (for example, programming languages)?",
