  "description": "We have been using Prerender.io since a while for prerendering our React-app pages to bots who don't execute JavaScript.<p>Now, starting from September 2022 Prerender forces us to their new pricing which would mean an increase from $21 to $220.<p>Do you know of any prerendering services which would be more affordable?
