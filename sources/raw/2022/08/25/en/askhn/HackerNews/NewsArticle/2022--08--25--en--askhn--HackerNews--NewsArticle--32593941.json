  "description": "Hey HN! I'm working on a talk/blog on a related topic and was curious to see what the case is for people here. I think each case is a bit different so I don't want to constrain people too much.<p>If you deploy ML to production in your group/team/company – what does production mean for you?<p>Examples:\n- &quot;We run a model once a week that predicts some stuff and stores it in a table, then the customer queries it&quot;\n- &quot;We create an inference endpoint on some cloud resource, which our product/users use to predict poses in videos&quot;\n- &quot;I wish I knew, we're still figuring it out&quot;\n- &quot;We deploy a model as part of a larger pipeline in a system of microservices (and other buzzwords)&quot;<p>Also, if you are in an extra-sharing mood – in your version of production, were there any counter-intuitive things you learned when you first set up the pipeline?<p>Cheers! Enjoy the picture Dall-E2 made for you of a cat asking for upvotes in return.\nhttps://labs.openai.com/s/2enTplV9c9OxU7lyqhyIjXlN",
