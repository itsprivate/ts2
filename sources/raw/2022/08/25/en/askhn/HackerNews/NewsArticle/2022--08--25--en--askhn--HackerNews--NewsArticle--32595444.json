  "description": "I've been using DDG as my primary search engine for years, and I've very rarely needed to try a query on Google--it usually felt like putting a &quot;!g&quot; in my queries gave worse results, not better.<p>But over the last week or so, I feel like I've been having to switch over to Google a lot more often. DDG just isn't turning up good results. I've noticed that no matter what I did, for instance, last night I could <i>not</i> get it to include IMDB in the results (even if I put &quot;imdb&quot; explicitly in the query).<p>Any ideas what's going on?",
