  "description": "I am in a leadership role that has limited-to-no project deadlines, a manager and team who actually values my work/input/guidance, and I WFH full time with minimal zoom meetings. But sometimes I feel stuck with no possible further career progression.<p>Are getting to a higher level and salary worth the time/effort required? Or, is it sort of like “Brandolini’s Law” where it would require that much more energy it’d end up just adversely impacting your overall well-being and isn’t worth the lost time?<p>I’m sort of at a crossroad in my career in deciding to keep being a tenured employee in my cushy role or jump ship to grab higher TC and add onto résumé.",
