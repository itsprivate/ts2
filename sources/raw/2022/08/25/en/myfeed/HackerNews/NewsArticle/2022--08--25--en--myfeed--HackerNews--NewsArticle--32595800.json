  "description": "Hey there -- thought I'd show this simple app off. I'm bad at rails/html/css/js but made a Rick Roll generator in just under a day with rails!<p>It's kind of incredible how relevant the rick roll still is after ~15 years.<p>Any generated Links Dynamically make opengraph tags to disguise themselves as whatever the user inputs.<p>It's been pretty fun to see people making their own Rick Roll links. Everyone wants to make a million dollar SaaS app but making dumb little apps like this is something I might do more of!",
