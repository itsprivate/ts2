  "description": "I was invited to try out Dall-e and I tried to see if it could generate a 3D image like the one I've made a long time ago. This is one of the results of the prompt &quot;piggy bank, 3D rendering&quot; - https://imgur.com/a/3hTzhEo<p>here's my original image - https://victorribeiro.com/3d/001.jpg<p>here's the 3D model of my piggy bank - https://victorribeiro.com/piggy/ (click and drag to rotate)<p>and here's Dall-e creation - https://labs.openai.com/s/u1LU53u5WIeSytNn9pYB2eOr (the lack of supporting edges at the end of the legs make the feet kinda round)<p>A few days ago I was thinking about selling this piggy bank image as a NFT (don't know why) and I was considering the implications of that, since I already sell the 3D model (in sites like turbosquid and cgtrader). Later I was wondering, Dall-E could as easily create  an image like mine...<p>My question is: could you sell Dall-e's creations? Could you copyright them? Are they infringing rights of other artists ?<p>Edit: a variation of the above looks even more similar https://labs.openai.com/s/pdKoNCAjmHXRUZoPThRVc0kr",
