  "description": "Sometimes UI can be distracting and I’ve found that I’m most focused when able to focus completely on the content on a page. I built HN Lite as a chrome extension to hide all information that isn’t vital to see.\nIt removes excess navigation, usernames, saving/reporting features, upvotes, voting tools, account access, and styling.<p>Essentially it’s a lurker’s tool. Almost entirely built around content consumption and exploration. Although it desperately needs dark mode.",
