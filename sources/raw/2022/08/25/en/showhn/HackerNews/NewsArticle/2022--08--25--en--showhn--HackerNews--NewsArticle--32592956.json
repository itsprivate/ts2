  "description": "Hey HN, I'm excited to share <a href=\"https://maskbunny.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://maskbunny.com/</a> with you, a privacy focused email forwarder. I wanted something like Apple Relay that isn't tied to the Apple ecosystem. It stores only what is required to comply with local laws and regulations for up to 7 days.<p>I didn't want to use disposable email providers that possibly leak emails to other users. Instead Maskbunny creates persistent aliases that are unique to you and offers a similar UX to Apple Relay.<p>There's a free base plan with some limits, including a single forwarding destination and a couple aliases. You can upgrade to the premium plan to increase the limits.<p>Looking forward to read your comments, suggestions, and feedback!",
