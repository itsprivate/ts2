  "description": "Someone has scraped my contact information from my profile and is sending me an unsolicted &quot;HackerNews&quot; newsletter.<p>People ... don't do that.<p>Yes, you have an unsubscribe link, but that doesn't excuse the unsolicited sending of a screencap of your rendering of &quot;top stories&quot;.<p>At the end you say:<p>&quot;You're receiving this email because you signed up on HackerNews&quot;<p>That is a lie, and a tactic used by utter scum.<p>Be better.<p>========<p><i>Edit: Note that this isn't random spam.  It's specific to HN, showing a screencap/image of the HN front page. And then it lies about &quot;signing up&quot;.  If it were random spam I'd delete and move on.  It's not, it's deliberately targetting the HN audience, and that's why I've mentioned it.</i>",
