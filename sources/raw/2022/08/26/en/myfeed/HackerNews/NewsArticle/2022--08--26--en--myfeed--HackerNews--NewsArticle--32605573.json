  "description": "Apps like dropbox, and google drive, we transfer don't work in some parts of Asia (India, China, etc) for various reasons. It's pretty hard to share huge docs/slides/presentations to our vendors and customers in this part of the world.<p>I work for a small company and needed to solve this problem, so I built a tool that is multi-cloud backed on Cloudflare R2 +  Alibaba Object Storage with a Vue js front-end. It does the job reasonably well. You can send 3gb of files to anyone and include a video message, too; please try it out and let me know what you think.<p>We have reasonably good usage of free users in both these countries and a number of businesses. I added an asynchronous video message feature that you can add to your outbound documents, this has helped increase document open rates; people tell me it helps close more deals.<p>Feel free to get in touch at rishi{dot}uttam@sinosend.com with your feedback.  <a href=\"https://sinosend.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://sinosend.com/</a>",
