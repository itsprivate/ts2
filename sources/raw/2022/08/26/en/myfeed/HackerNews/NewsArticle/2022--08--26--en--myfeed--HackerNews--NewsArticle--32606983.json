  "description": "For some stupid reason, I'm not allowed to use Joplin by myself LOL. So, I want to use a note taking app that's very similar to it.<p>I want:<p>1) Image pasting<p>2) Tabs with close UI there<p>Basically sth that looks like notepad++ but with image pasting facility where I can see image directly without having to open new window<p>I tried zim, but it was stupid UI for me. Closing tabs was hard. And as soon as I started writing in 1 note tab, that tab would come to the right highlighted. Pretty annoying.<p>Any recommendations? Please share.",
