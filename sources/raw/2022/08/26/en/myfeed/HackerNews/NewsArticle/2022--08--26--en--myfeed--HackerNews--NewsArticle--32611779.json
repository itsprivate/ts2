  "description": "I wrote my first lines of code almost 39 years ago (I'm 45 now), sold my first software as shareware 35 years ago and was enjoying software development every day since.<p>But something happened one or two years ago and now all the big problems of the teams I see seem so self-inflicted, my own team/company included.<p>It really doesn't matter what I want as my voice inside of our company doesn't count much and people really try to make all the silly mistakes possible...<p>Most of the time the devs of my company shoot themselves in the foot (not literally), but as a whole the company shoots itself in the head really.<p>I don't know what to do. I don't feel the energy anymore to do anything about it, really. I just gave up, and I am tremendously sad about it.<p>Is there some advice out there of what to do to get my &quot;mojo&quot; back?<p>With the kindest regards,\nSteviee",
