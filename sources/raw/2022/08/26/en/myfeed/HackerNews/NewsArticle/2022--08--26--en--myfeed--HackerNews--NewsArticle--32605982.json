  "description": "As the title say, I have noticed some time ago that using Firefox on android, when I enter text on google site, past searches are been suggested. It wasn't the case in the past and it got me wondering, tested the same using other mobile browsers and none had the same behavior. So it isn't like Google's showing off that they identify you and your device without cookies, but rather Firefox issue. Found today an open github issue  from two months ago, using colorful language, but there's no progress. Personally, a privacy breech from Firefox always hurts more, this one is a blocker for me and I will not be able to continue using Firefox on my mobile until it is fixed.<p>https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/25787",
