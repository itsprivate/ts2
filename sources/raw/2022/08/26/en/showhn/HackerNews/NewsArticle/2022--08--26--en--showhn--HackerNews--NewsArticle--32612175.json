  "description": "Hey there, I made a new library for React data fetching.<p>XSWR is very inspired from SWR (which stands for &quot;Stale While Revalidate&quot;).<p>In fact, it's a side project I made to fill in the gaps of SWR, that ended up production-ready.<p>XSWR uses two new approaches compared to other data fetching libraries like swr or react-query:<p>- Encapsulating key, fetcher and resource type in a single abstraction called &quot;handle&quot;.<p>- Composing features with very simple hooks instead of having bloated configuration patterns and unexpected behaviours.<p>By using these two approaches, XSWR aims to help you highly centralize and reuse things.<p>Docs:\n<a href=\"https://xswr.hazae41.me/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://xswr.hazae41.me/</a><p>Comparison with swr and react-query:\n<a href=\"https://xswr.hazae41.me/faq/comparison\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://xswr.hazae41.me/faq/comparison</a><p>Thanks for you feedbacks!",
