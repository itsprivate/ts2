  "description": "Hey HN!<p>As a geriatric Millennial, I used to spend an ungodly amount of time hanging around IRC and  discovering sites on the old web. During the Pandemic, I got into hanging around standup comedy hangouts in VRChat. Taking friends to visit a virtual Mcdonald's[1] or joining a Karaoke party in a Minecraft world[2] brought back that sense of rapport and presence (multiplied by 1000) from my IRC days.<p>Problem is, <i>finding any of this content is extremely difficult</i>. Most of it is locked inside native apps and isn't semantically relevant to Google (I could never imagine there are tons of people attending Yoga classes or morning stretch sessions or going to the church <i>every week</i>, in VR!).<p>So I repurposed an open source project[3], enlisted a couple of folks to hack together, and we're now indexing a ton of content from sites &amp; apps - news, events, worlds, assets - and making it all searchable.<p>This is still very much an alpha, and mostly focused on content from VRChat and AltspaceVR (plus some news outlets), but I'd love to hear your thoughts &amp; feedback.<p>Site: evrthn.com [4] (pronounced &quot;everything&quot;)<p>Thank you!<p>[1] <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3ArLjNk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://bit.ly/3ArLjNk</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3R5Pg1e\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://bit.ly/3R5Pg1e</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://github.com/cloudsearch\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://github.com/cloudsearch</a><p>[4] <a href=\"https://evrthn.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://evrthn.com</a>",
