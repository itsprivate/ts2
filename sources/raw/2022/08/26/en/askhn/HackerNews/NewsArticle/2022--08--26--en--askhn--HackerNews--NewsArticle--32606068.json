  "description": "I would like to know, how you manage Windows re-installation or migration.<p>Most time consuming part for me is restoring of program settings. Chocolatey (mostly) solved issue with installation, but personal data that are usually in many different places (AppData, ProgramData, Program Files, Documents...) on system disk are really painful to restore.<p>Also system settings is always checking all settings one by one and tick same options over and over.<p>I'm not confident with simple &quot;system reinstallation&quot; that keeps your data on disk and repair just OS files. I prefer to do system disk format and fresh installation. With time, OS disk usually store many useless files that I want to get rid of it.",
