  "description": "Dear HN,<p>I'm looking for examples of great landing pages that cater to an developer/hacker audience.<p>To me it seems like the big players in the industry have outgrown their initial customerbase and are targeting businesses in terms of speech, graphics and information presented. (See Twillio, Sendgrid, stripe to some degree...)<p>Can you point out some great landing pages that sold you on the technology? Or if you are a startup/dev, what was your though process or what works for you?",
