  "description": "This might be what a &quot;flop&quot; is when thinking of GPUs.<p>My question is aimed at microcontrollers. If you want to know what it can do, when seeing specs like 80Mhz, 1MB ram/flash, 32bit CPU.<p>What could you do with that?<p>I don't think it's possible or at least not sure how to self-write C++ after compiling. That would be interesting.<p>Or make sub functions that are compiled however can be combined to do more things.",
