  "description": "I've been using GoReleaser to build and publish my Go binaries to GitHub. I tried installing the Mac on Catalina and hit the &quot;untrusted developer&quot; problem.<p>Is it possible to distribute these binaries without paying for and setting up code signing? Seems that 10.15 is more strict about these things.<p>Does the homebrew path get around this by building what you install locally?",
