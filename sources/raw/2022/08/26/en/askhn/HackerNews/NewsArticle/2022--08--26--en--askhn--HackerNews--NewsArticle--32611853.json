  "description": "I am trying to help my brother find the right laptop for his daughter. Her school sent out some basic requirements which are:<p>- PC with Windows\n- At least 8GB memory\n- At least 200GB storage\n- processor that can handle video conferences (they claim some weaker processors can't handle video meetings), ideally with built-in webcam<p>I'm a Mac user and I don't know much about Windows machines so don't really know where to start. All I know is that there are many laptops that fit the bill specs-wise, but many are cheap with crappy screens and poor overall performance.<p>I think they're willing to spend $1,000-$1,500.<p>Appreciate any guidance you can provide. Thank you!",
