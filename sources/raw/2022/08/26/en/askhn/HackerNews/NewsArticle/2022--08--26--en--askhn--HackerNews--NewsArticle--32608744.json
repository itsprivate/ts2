  "description": "I admit that I don't have a high EQ. I don't read the cues as fast as I should and that often leads to situations where I trust someone (a boss, a professor, a coworker, random person online) only to be disappointed that they are in fact full of bs.<p>One example is this website:<p>https://lifearchitect.ai/<p>Watching some of this guy's videos and browsing his website, I call bs. I guess what gave him away was three things:<p>- shiny, fancy, stock-image, YouTube videos<p>- Big claims and quoting himself on his frontpage<p>- Just the whole &quot;I know all about AI and do consulting and speaking&quot; and looking like a &quot;news media showman&quot;.<p>I think there must be more ways to call bs on such people. Care to share yours?",
