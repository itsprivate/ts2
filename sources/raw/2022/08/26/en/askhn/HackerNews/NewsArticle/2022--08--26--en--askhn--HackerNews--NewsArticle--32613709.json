  "description": "I have an LG 27UK850 27 inch 4K monitor. It's been serviceable, but WFH has really exposed how lacking in brightness it is against day light whereas when I was in office, the pervasive fluorescent lighting seemed to change how I was perceiving my work monitor.<p>Any recommendations for a large (&gt; 27 in), possibly curved, and bright (&gt; 400 nits) 4K+ monitor? If so let me know any cons as well that I should consider.",
