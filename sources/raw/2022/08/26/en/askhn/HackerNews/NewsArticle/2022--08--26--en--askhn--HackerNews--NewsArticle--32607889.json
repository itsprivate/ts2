  "description": "I am curious what people reach for when writing CLIs these days; specifically what language, libraries (if any), and why?<p>By CLI, I mean any executable program or script like git that supports commands, sub-commands, and POSIX-style flags.<p>I mostly work in Go, and have been happy with the standard library[1] or Cobra[2]. I also write a lot of shell scripts.<p>I thought it would be interesting to see some other approaches.<p>[1]: https://pkg.go.dev/flag\n[2]: https://cobra.dev",
