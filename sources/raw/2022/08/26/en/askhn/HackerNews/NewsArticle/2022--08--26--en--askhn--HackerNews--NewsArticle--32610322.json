  "description": "I simply love my MacBook Air (2010, tapered body). The keyboard, the weight, the shape, the trackpack.<p>Although I still use it (with Linux) and have a couple of top-spec daily drivers, I feel it's a matter of time it will &quot;join the bleedin' choir invisible&quot;. Which modern laptop will provide a similar feel, weight and size?<p>It doesn't need to be Apple, of course and lower end specs (RAM, CPU) are fine too, since I'll use it mostly for light work.",
