  "description": "My first is due 3 days ago. I'm told that I'm going to have no time any more and good sleep is a thing of the past.<p>I'm worried, I don't work well when tired. I'm just starting to get in the habit of investing in myself as a developer and am reading a lot, practicing a lot. This has made me, in my estimation, a much better programmer. Does this end when you have kids?<p>What was it like for you out there that have gone through this change in life?",
