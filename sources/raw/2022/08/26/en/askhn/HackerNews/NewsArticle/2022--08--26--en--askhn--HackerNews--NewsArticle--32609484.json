  "description": "I’m 27 years old and started hacking around when I was 13 with vb6.<p>I’m realizing all I build these days are more advanced CRUD apps with more advanced security, but I’m bored. It’s a sad cycle because cost of living to support my partner and I is high, so I cannot just quit (she’s in academia), however my love for tech is still strong, but I need harder and different problems. What can I do?<p>My buddies and I want to start a company as we are all in the same position, but we have no grand ideas. What have you all done to exit the endless loop of existentialism in the field?",
