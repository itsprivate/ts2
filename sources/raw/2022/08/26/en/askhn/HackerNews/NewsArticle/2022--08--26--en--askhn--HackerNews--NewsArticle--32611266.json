  "description": "I'm wondering if it's possible to successfully strike on my own, as say a startup founder or an indie gamedev, if my body is just not compatible with working 60 hours per week, as is advocated by the likes of Jon Blow or John Carmack. Did anyone here accomplish anything hard, while only being able to work for say 20-25 hours per week? BTW I'm not interested in accomplishments while working for someone else (i.e. in a job), as I've had career success already and know that it can be done under such limitations.",
