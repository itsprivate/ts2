  "description": "We have finally launched Domfetch!<p>Domfetch is a free platform to find expired domains. Users can search through domains that are (almost) available for registration. We enrich these domains with extra data to help users find valuable domains.<p>We created this tool because we found the (free) alternatives lacking certain data, such as Moz, Alexa history (we check 5 years of data) &amp; search volume history over a period of 1 year.<p>Let us know what you think! More features and tld's will be added in the near future.",
