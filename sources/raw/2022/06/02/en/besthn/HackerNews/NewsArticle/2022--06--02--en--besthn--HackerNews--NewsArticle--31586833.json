  "description": "I've seen some interests in (simulation) video games here on HN so I thought I'd share a short version of our story.<p>More than 6 years ago, me and my friend from university were playing around with an idea of making a game we always wanted to play. We worked on it on weekends but the progress was quite slow, especially due to so many dead ends and wasted effort.<p>Eventually however, we solidified our direction and decided to take the risk to resign from our well paid SWE jobs and work on it full time. It took more than a year but yesterday we have finally released it on Steam: <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1594320/Captain_of_Industry/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1594320/Captain_of_Indust...</a><p>I am still not sure if this was a good decision financially, but unlike in a corporate environment, I am so much happier working on a product that I can put my love into and see people enjoy it, see my direct impact, and be able to make big decisions (although this also adds a lot of stress).<p>I also quite enjoy the added SWE challenges. I had to write so many complex algorithms (path-finding, logistics, serialization, ...) and optimize things down to bits (shaders, compression of in-memory data, ...) that were rarely required by my corp job.<p>Anyhow, this is getting a little long, feel free to ask any questions, I will do my best to answer them.",
