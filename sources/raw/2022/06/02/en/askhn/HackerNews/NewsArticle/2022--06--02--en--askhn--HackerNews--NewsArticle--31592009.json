  "description": "A Cyber Deck is a creative computer design.<p>Cyber Decks come in all shapes and sizes.<p>Cyber Decks are unusual and interesting and futuristic, or retro, or cyberpunk or steampunk.<p>People obviously love Cyber Decks.<p>Here's some examples of Cyber Decks:<p>https://www.google.com/search?q=%22cyber+deck%22+computer<p>There's a Reddit devoted to Cyber Decks:<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberDeck/<p>There's videos of Cyber Decks:<p>https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cyber+deck+computer<p>BUT..... you can't buy anything like a cyber deck.  Search Amazon, eBay, Google Shopping - <i>nothing</i>.  Not one single company manufactures anything like a cyber deck, in any form at all.<p>All hardware manufacturers make is the same old rectangular boxes.  There's a very small number of unusual shapes, including one pyramid.  But for the most part even these &quot;unusually shaped&quot; cases are basically the same old design, pretty much a box with a motherboard in it, with unusual angles on the box.<p>Why is there so little innovation in computer design when the hobbyists are clearly showing what people like and are interested in?",
