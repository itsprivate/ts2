  "description": "I'm trying to think up ideas of what I could do with an intermittent &quot;excess&quot; of electricity - only at certain hours of the day up to a certain (fixed) amount. Let's say around 10kW hours a day between 12pm and 3pm (I've described my case below, but other people would have different scenarios).<p>Ideally the extra energy would be used to help reduce environmental impact rather than making money, so crypto mining (for example) is not an option.<p>Here are some of my thoughts:<p>- heat water for home usage (heat pump); this solution is already deployed, but there is only so much hot water one needs\n- charge an EV; I don't own one presently, but it an option for the future\n- fight the current 70% rule in Germany (this is the cause of my excess, see below)\n- generate H2 via electrolysis; not sure what to do with H2 then. What would be interesting would be to be able to &quot;charge&quot; fuel cells and store them for use in winter, or compress H2 into cylinders? Not sure what can fit into my garage / would be affordable.\n- pumped water storage; I suspect the energies involved at home are insignificant vs industrial hydro solutions\n- convert to microwave and beam into space\n- run an industrial press to compress my lawn cuttings / garden waste into pellets and dump them into a deep lake\n- a magical machine that extracts Co2 from the air and produces a fine black powder which I could compress and dump into a deep lake\n- ...<p>Some background:<p>In Germany, excess domestic solar panel production can be pushed into the grid for a small (cash) refund, but there is a strange rule : only 70% of the maximum panel output is allowed to be pushed. So if the panels could generate 10kW at midday, without anything turned on at home, a maximum of 7kW can be pushed. This effect is only for a few &quot;peak sun&quot; hours (say 12pm to 3pm), but means that roughly 10kW hours of electricity is &quot;lost&quot; (the system is throttled back via the charge controller, so the energy isn't lost or wasted, it just isn't produced)",
