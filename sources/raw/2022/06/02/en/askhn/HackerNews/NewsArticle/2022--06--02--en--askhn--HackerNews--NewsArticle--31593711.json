  "description": "My brother, who works as hardware installation tech, is an absolute gem who loves communications hardware, radio and internet broadcast tech, cars, bikes, whiskey, camping. I've been looking for something magical, that he will find useful and unexpected.<p>Over the years I've bought him: expensive whiskey or bourbon, a metal detector, radio gear, antennas, camping gear.. I'm looking for something I wouldn't think of to surprise him. Even better, something he can do with the teenage kids.<p>Any ideas, of something you bought yourself or were gifted and love?",
