  "description": "Hi all,<p>In July I will be starting my first full time job as an SRE after graduating college, at an awesome company of large size. I’m looking for general advice (or granular!) for how to make the most of my first days and weeks, as well as what to do and not do as I transition.<p>Furthermore, I haven’t had an SRE internship before, so I’ll be learning a great deal on the way :-)",
