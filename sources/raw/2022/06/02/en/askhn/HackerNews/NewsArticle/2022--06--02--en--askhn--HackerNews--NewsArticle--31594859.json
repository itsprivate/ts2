  "description": "As a Brit, in honour of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee I want to understand what the HN community think of the Queen.<p>I grew up in and live in the UK, and have personally never understood why we have a monarchy in 2022 as it is blatantly anti-democratic and anti-meritocratic. Yet speaking to family and friends as well as folks from other countries, I am often taken aback by her popularity and airing my opinions often feels a bit controversial.<p>Where do you stand?",
