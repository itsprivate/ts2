  "description": "Hi HN,\nI'm a software dev with 10yrs XP. Mostly mobile and gaming.<p>I'm interested to take the leap and go fully into blockchain/solidity.<p>I'm looking for some bootcamps, or online learning platform that can guide me towards landing a position as a solidity developer.<p>I'm actually interested to know any experience from other developers that took a similar leap. What helped you get into so-called web3 development?",
