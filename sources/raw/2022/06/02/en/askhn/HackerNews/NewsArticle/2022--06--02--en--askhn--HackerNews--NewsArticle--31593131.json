  "description": "I always wonder why Android doesn’t have its own HTTP library. They stopped supporting Volley and HttpURLConnection. For example on iOS, I don’t have to use third-party libraries for HTTP requests, because URLSession class is enough.<p>On Android, new developers have to choose several HTTP libraries, plus they will encounter different arguments on which one is better and more robust. There is Ktor, Retrofit, Fuel, etc.",
