  "description": "It seems like the stock markets (USA) growth is strongly correlated to inflation. The more money the government prints the more the stock market goes up. So the market doesn't actually represent value in a company but instead debt owed to somebody else.<p>What are the implications of this and is it a bad thing?<p>What would the market look like if we corrected for the money supply?<p>PS: I'm asking here because when asking at other places I was told to just not worry about it.",
