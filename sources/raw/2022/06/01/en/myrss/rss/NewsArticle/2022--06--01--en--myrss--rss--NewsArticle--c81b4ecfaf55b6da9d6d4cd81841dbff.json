  "description": "As of .NET 3.0, LINQ (and the often related Lambda Expressions) have been available for our use and abuse. LINQ stands for Language INtegrated Query, and is a method of modelling OO data in a more or less relational sense that is not unlike databases. And just like databases, it comes with a cost.\nTo offset this cost, LINQ uses Deferred Execution. Deferred Execution means that the code is not executed until it is needed.",
