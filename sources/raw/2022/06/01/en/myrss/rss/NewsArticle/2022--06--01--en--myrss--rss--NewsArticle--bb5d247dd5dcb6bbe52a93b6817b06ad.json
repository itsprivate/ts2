  "description": "As a developer working for a company, you probably work on a team. The interactions on these teams are sometimes pleasant, and other times hostile. Whatâ€™s interesting to me is that a lot of the time, a hostile interaction could have been a pleasant one if only approached differently. Hostile teams are created by the actions of the people on them, not by the situations they encounter. One such hostile action is blame.",
