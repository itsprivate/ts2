  "description": "Note: I want to present this as a concept and not a full featured product that’s ready for pro users.<p>Problem I have faced with vertically expanding trees like workflowy/dynalist is that it’s hard to quickly navigate to a specific descendant node. With CardFlow that’s pretty easy, try it yourself.<p>I wish somebody will use this side-expanding tree concept and make a full featured app. I want to use such a product but I don’t have the acumen to build one myself.",
