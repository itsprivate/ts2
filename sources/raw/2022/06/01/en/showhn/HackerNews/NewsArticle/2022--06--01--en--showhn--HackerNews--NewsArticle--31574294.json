  "description": "Background:  I'm an older, self-taught developer who was a team parent for my kid's sports team.  I wanted to embed our Teamsnap ICal calendar in our team's Squarespace website only to find out that its kind of a pain in the ass.  Yes, you can use Google Calendar to do it but the design looks about 15 years old.<p>So, a couple Fridays ago with a bottle of wine and some open source help from ICal.Net &amp; FullCalendar.io, I got something working.  Spent the last few weeks cleaning it up and adding in a subscription component.  Hoping to break even on hosting.<p>I know this is a niche thing that I pretty much built to scratch my own itch.  I anticipate tens (if not DOZENS!) of other potential users are out there...but, what the heck...you are supposed to &quot;Just Ship It&quot;, right?? (<a href=\"https://kitze.io/posts/saddest-just-ship-it-story-ever\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://kitze.io/posts/saddest-just-ship-it-story-ever</a>)<p>So here you go HN...let me know what you think but go easy on me ;-)",
