  "description": "I had transferred the domain from Namescheap to cloudflare because I had heard good things about them on here. Everything was working well (Mainly use this domain for my personal emails) and now nothing is working no warnings, nothing.<p>I contact cloudflare support and they transfer me over to their &quot;Trust &amp; Safety&quot; team.<p>This is the response I get.<p>------<p>`\nHello,<p>Your account violated our terms of service specifically fraud. The suspension is permanent and we will not be making changes on our end.<p>Regards,\nCloudflare Trust &amp; Safety\n`<p>-----<p>What the heck is that supposed to even mean? Has anyone else had any way to deal with this sort of issue? Anyone from cf lurking here who can help me please? This is my personal domain and a lot of my other accounts are attached to this. Like what am I even supposed to do here ?",
