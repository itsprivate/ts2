  "description": "I'm hoping there's a standardized format/schema out there for &quot;cataloging all the assets&quot; that make up a software system. I.e, from Storage drives to container images, etc. would all have a centralized db entry with a unique UUID, and perhaps other attributes.<p>Purpose is for risk management, I'm sure this is a tractable (read: solved) problem; but my research skills are failing me this morning.<p>I'm picturing something like an ARN but across a company. We can leverage terraform meta to tag things consistently",
