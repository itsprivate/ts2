  "description": "I took some offense at Elon's comments about the products other companies may or may not ship while teams are working remote. To be honest, I'm not really sure what qualifies as a great product at Tesla these days. Automotive editorial aside, I thought I'd throw it out to HN to talk about the cool things they're shipping while working remote. No doubt there are TONS of actual products that people release while working remote.<p>What have you released recently? Why is it awesome?<p>Ref: https://electrek.co/2022/06/01/elon-musk-tesla-employees-come-back-office-or-quit/",
