  "description": "I've been on the hunt for a generalized formatter to handle markdown, YAML, JSON, and other common file types. All of my open source projects typically have at least markdown and YAML present. I typically employ a specialized formatter/linter for the project-specific language, but handling the other types has always been a pain.<p>Prettier is the closest thing I've found, even if it's primarily targeting Javascript. My biggest gripe is the dependencies that it ships with. I'd love to find a static binary that can accomplish the same thing. Any suggestions?",
