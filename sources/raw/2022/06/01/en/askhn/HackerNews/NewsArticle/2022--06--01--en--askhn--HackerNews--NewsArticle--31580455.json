  "description": "I am a Russian citizen, but I have a EU blue card and have been living and working in the Czech Republic since last year. I recently found out that my Oracle account has been suspended. I contacted Oracle support (profilehelp_ww at oracle.com) and provided them with my ID and CZ address upon request. However, the account was not unblocked and they stopped responding to my emails.<p>I'm a Oracle Certified Professional Java developer, but now I can't download my certificate from the Oracle site (certview).<p>I paid for Oracle training, I paid for the exam and now I can't confirm that I have the certification.",
