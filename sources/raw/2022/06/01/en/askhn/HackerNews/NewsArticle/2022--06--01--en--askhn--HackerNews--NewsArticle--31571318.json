  "description": "Over the last ~five years my wife and I transitioned from city to rural life. Since leaving the city our priorities changed; we've become more focused on caring for our bodies and the environment and participating in activities that support those things (growing food, foraging, hunting, caring for the forest).<p>I have a software development practice: I build Tap [0] and do generalist web development consulting. Over time I see the farm and the software activity supporting each other. I'm curious, if there's anyone on HN that's further down this road than I am. How's it going? What does your practice look like? Do you continue to enjoy farming and development? Has one or the other taken over?<p>Thanks!<p>[0] https://www.tatatap.com",
