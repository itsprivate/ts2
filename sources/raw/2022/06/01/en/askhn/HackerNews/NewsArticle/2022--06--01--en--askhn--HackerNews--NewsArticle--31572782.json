  "description": "I've received half a dozen emails about 'how to talk to kids' about violence, how to handle grief, etc. etc, but nothing about prevention of any kind. It seems that politically, in the US, nothing will happen. There was a short thread about fortification of schools. This to me seems like a great idea, and could probably be done with federal funding. There are people here who know about (physical) security. What are good ideas that can be implemented on a local level? I'm mostly wondering about schools - but for shootings in general?",
