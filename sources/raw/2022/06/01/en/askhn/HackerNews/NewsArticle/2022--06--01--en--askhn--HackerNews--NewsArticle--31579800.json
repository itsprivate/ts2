  "description": "So, does anyone have first-hand experience in receiving small/micro-funding for side projects, but outside of US?<p>I've found several organizations that provide this kind of funding [0], but most of them are in US. These organizations are covering either projects by people in US or, if the execution is outside the US, the funded projects are mostly community based initiatives.<p>So, is there such an organization that provides similar, small scale funds (few hundreds of USD monthly) for covering infrastructure costs (like server and similar) during development of software projects?\nHave you used something similar in the past, or now, and what is your experience of both the application process and later?<p>The most similar thing I have found to what I'm looking for is the micro-grant fund for side projects by Tyk [1], but they're not opening the applications soon.<p>[0]: https://github.com/sakofchit/fund-my-project\n[1]: https://tyk.io/fund/",
