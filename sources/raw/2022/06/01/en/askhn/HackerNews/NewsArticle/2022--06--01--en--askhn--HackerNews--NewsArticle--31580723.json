  "description": "I started working for a tech company immediately out of high school. The company was a startup that has seen notable growth.<p>I joined one year into the business and have been there for the last three years. I took on a lot of responsibility early on because I was excited and I learned a lot. I worked on tasks that had a direct impact on revenue.<p>Now I'm feeling burnt out and question whether I started on this path too early. I had really high expectations of myself and now I am wrestling with this feeling of guilt that I can't get motivated like I used to. I've tried doing the things with tech I love -- like working on my website -- but lose energy quickly.<p>I know I'm early in my career but I feel tired and unmotivated at work. Work seems like a never-ending treadmill of tasks, many of which are more bureaucratic now and don't interest me. What should I do?<p>Update: One thing that's worth noting is my job has changed in this time to something that doesn't interest me as much. The company has grown to 200+ people and I'm struggling to see how my skills apply to my role since my first role is now no longer relevant to our core business.",
