  "description": "I realized, after reading that Newton article, that I actually own one iPad and one Huawei pad but not doing anything with them.<p>The iPad mostly sits and collects dust and the Huawei pad serves as a music player for my 18-month kid. Recently I managed to read a bit on it but the experience is mediocre.<p>I'm wondering what's your use case? I feel I'm missing out a whole range of electronics out there.",
