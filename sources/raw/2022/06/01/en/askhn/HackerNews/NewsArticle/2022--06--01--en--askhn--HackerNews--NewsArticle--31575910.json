  "description": "Based on what's currently happening with &quot;false positive&quot; bans [0] being automatically issued for flagged payment methods [1], I'm thinking on using Cloudflare for mirror or backup domains only, and let users know if the main site ever goes down to use CF's instead. It's easy to automate this redirection from an app, are there any browser extensions that can help with this?<p>[0]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31574702\n[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31575361",
