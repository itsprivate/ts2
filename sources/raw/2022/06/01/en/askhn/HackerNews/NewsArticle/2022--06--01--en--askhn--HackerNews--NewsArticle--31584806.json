  "description": "We are a small (~50 persons, mostly juniors) 4 years old software shop that do outsourcing mostly. The senior team have development and QA background with good skill and experience, done &gt;20 finished projects for both start-ups and enterprises. Those are to say that we do have the skills and experience on getting things done and get the bucks.<p>I did most of the DevOps for the company, and I did get the job done, as in, project A requires an AWS setup with K8s, Lambda, CI/CD,... , I can setup that, no big problem with help from Google. So, in the middle of last year, I got promoted from Senior Full-Stack Engineer to Senior DevOps Engineer, Head of Operations (with operations are everything outside of dev and test).<p>I've been struggling since then, as the only DevOps guy in the company and no experience/mentor in this role, I don't really know what to do. So, after 1 year, I have almost no progress and nothing to promise, leader understood the situation and didn't push me much but I still feel pretty bad.<p>Some of the areas that I'm stuck:<p>- Direction: as we invest more in our own SaaS, I don't know what need to be done outside of getting the thing running on production and watch out for error and outage and SSL expire.\n- Certifications: I heard about ISO 27000s, NIST xxx, ... but what certificate is the most important for organization/product, what need to get first, roadmap,...\n- Training: I need to train new DevOps, but I realized that I'm doing it really inefficiently, asking the juniors to watch Udemy courses and practice by themselves get to nowhere now.\n- Conformity: when working with enterprises, you usually get those big questionnaires and request for documents of network/asset/data/... security/policy, we got over by asking for example documents and fill it in. Now I know I need to write those anew for our organization, I don't know what is needed.\n- Adaptation: most of my new tech knowledges came from Hacker News, reading the articles. Is it an efficient way to know the latest trends, newest vulnerabilites,... ?\n- Management: I wrote my first yearly report in only 1 page, team and I expected more information but had no clue what else should be in there. I'm also not sure all the areas I listed out here are all there is, could have missed something big.<p>So, what are some good, important resources to learn in this new position that can help me overcome those issues?",
