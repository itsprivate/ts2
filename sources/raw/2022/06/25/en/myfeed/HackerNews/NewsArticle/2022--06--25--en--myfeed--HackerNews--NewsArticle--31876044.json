  "description": "I'm currently dealing with a lawyer who lied to me about securing a Hearing for my case, after I paid them &gt; $20k to secure face time with a Judge.<p>Turns out, when my new lawyer who replaced them asked the Judge and opposing counsel about the Hearing date, he was told there was no sign of one ever being set.<p>I reached out to the original lawyer for answers. They insisted, twice, that we had a hearing date set at the time their counsel ended.<p>When I asked once more for evidence of this, the lawyer reversed position and claimed that the date had <i>always</i> been tenuous, and that I had been informed of this (?!).<p>Real and genuine 'Always at War with Eurasia', 'There Are Four Lights' shit.<p>Old lawyer then contacted my new lawyer, against my express request they be left to focus on the original case. New lawyer called me to ask me to drop the matter.<p>The takes from r/legaladvice are that this must be <i>my</i> fault somehow. It isn't. The facts are exactly as stated.<p>Is there any hope for accountability against a lawyer within the US legal system?<p>PA, USA.",
