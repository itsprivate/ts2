  "description": "At work I contribute to a moderately-sized monorepo at 70 thousand files, 8-digit lines of code and hundreds of PRs merged every day. One day I opened a remote buffer at that repository and ran M-x find-file.\nfind-file is an interactive function that shows a narrowed list of files in the current directory, prompts the user to filter and scroll through candidates, and for a file to open. Emacs froze for 5 seconds before showing me the find-file prompt.",
