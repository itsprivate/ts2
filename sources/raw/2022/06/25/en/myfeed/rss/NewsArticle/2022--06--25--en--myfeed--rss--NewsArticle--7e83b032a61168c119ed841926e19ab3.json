  "description": "It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I changed things up, so I decided on a new Twitter handle and blog domain.\nThis site is now hosted at davidhaney.io and called &amp;ldquo;David Haney&amp;rdquo; which in my opinion is a much better (and more descriptive and maybe even more egotistical) domain than haneycodes.net and the old name of &amp;ldquo;Haney Codes .NET&amp;rdquo;\nDon&amp;rsquo;t worry - haneycodes.net deep links will redirect properly for years to come, so you won&amp;rsquo;t miss anything at all.",
