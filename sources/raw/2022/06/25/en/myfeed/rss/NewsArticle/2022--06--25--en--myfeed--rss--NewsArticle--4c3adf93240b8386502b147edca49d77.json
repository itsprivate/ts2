  "description": "Sabbatical week one is complete, and I&amp;rsquo;m finally finding some time to blog about it!\nI had a pretty active week. It started with hurricane preparations as Dorian burled toward Florida, however in the end we suffered a very light glancing blow. In short, we got off easy.\nThe Bahamas did not get so lucky, however, and got pretty messed up. I&amp;rsquo;d love for you to take a moment to donate to their recovery here: https://www.",
