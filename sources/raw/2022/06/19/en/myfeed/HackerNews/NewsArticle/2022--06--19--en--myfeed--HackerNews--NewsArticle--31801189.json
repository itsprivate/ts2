  "description": "Hey folks, Michael here.<p>I have been working in this project on and of for about a year and a half and I finally got it into a state where I can share it. I initially started this project to learn Rust and afterwards decided to make it useful for others.<p>Vulpo Auth is an authentication server that you can host yourself. The goal was to make it as easy as possible for you to get started and have a complete authentication solution without you having to configure anything. Project Website: https://auth.vulpo.dev<p>The Project contains:\n  - Auth Server (Rust)\n  - Admin Dashboard\n  - JS and react SDK\n  - Prebuilt Web UI (currently react) (https://auth.vulpo.dev/ui)\n  - rust SDK for rocket<p>Some of the features:\n  - Email and Password Auth\n  - Passwordless Auth\n  - Google Auth\n  - Translateable Email Templates\n  - Enable/Disable Sign In or Sign Up\n  - Password Reset Flow\n  - Update Email Flow<p>There is still a lot to do, the code base is full of experimental ideas and there a bunch of things to clean up, but first I want to focus on writing documentation and guides before adding more features.<p>Besides the missing documentation, what are you missing?",
