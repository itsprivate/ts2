  "description": "During the pandemic, I realized that academic research wasn't for me (I'm about to finish my Ph.D.), and I started specializing in data science and machine learning.<p>I just moved to San Diego but can't get a job until I receive my green card, and I feel I am becoming unproductive. I have never had too much free time, and I don't know how to deal with it?<p>Any advice to continue with the career change?\nAfter I get my work authorization, should I apply for internships or entry-level jobs?<p>Thanks",
