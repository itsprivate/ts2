  "description": "Well I failed badly in my mission to blog every week of 2017. I guess life and stuff just got in the way in the end. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to be more consistent in the second half of 2018.\nAnyway, I bring some news: I have a new blog engine, and we are hiring at Stack Overflow!\nNew blog engine I was previously using WordPress but had many issues and concerns with it.",
