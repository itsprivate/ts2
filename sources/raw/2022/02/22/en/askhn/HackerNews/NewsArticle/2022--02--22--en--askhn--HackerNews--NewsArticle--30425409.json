  "description": "Every day there are posts here with some Twitter thread as the source.<p>This used to be just annoying in the past (because of the overall low quality of such sources), but now it's gone too far.\nTwitter won't let you see the content without logging in anymore. At least this is what I see when I open a Twitter link and scroll down: https://i.imgur.com/E0h2CtQ.png<p>There are many free blog posting platforms out there that don't annoy users like that and — needless to say — are in a much more readable format. All it takes is a couple of minutes to sign up...<p>I think such a HN rule could help in promoting common decency on the web.",
