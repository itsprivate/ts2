  "description": "Our US-based non-profit, Open Law Library, would like to offer positions to Ukrainian developers. We would ideally like to pay for services weekly in advance, rather than arrears, to assist with immediate cash flow needs.<p>Does anybody have suggestions on the best way to provide payment? I understand Ukrainian banks are still up for now, so are wire transfers the most reliable, or should we use visa/master card e-gift cards? Something else?<p>Aside from the &quot;who is hiring&quot; posts tomorrow, are there any boards or services we should be posting to?<p>Thank you!<p>David Greisen\ndgreisen@openlawlib.org",
