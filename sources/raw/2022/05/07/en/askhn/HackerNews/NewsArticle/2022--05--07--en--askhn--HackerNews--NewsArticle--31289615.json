  "description": "Some things that come to mind are<p>1. Swappable config files (hard to do in frameworks like django where config is code)<p>2. Can't use proprietary 3rd party apis in core logic or if you do there has to be an open interface to be able to adapt to different vendors (payment_provider_interface vs stripe)<p>3. Minimize friction for new developer to spin up copy. Meaning if you're forced to rely on multiple services, use something like docker compose to allow a single command to bring up the who command after a git clone.<p>What are some of your ideas?",
