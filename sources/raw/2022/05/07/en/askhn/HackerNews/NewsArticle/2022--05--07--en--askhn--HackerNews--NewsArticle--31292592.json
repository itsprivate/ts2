  "description": "I know I have OCD, and I tend to restart paragraphs when I get distracted before reading to the end of them. This is a terrible habit in a world of constant distraction. But once in awhile I find that I've re-read the same paragraph in an article half a dozen times while bouncing between tasks, and only on the sixth reading do I realize it contains a spelling error right at the point where I kept losing it.<p>I've started to give myself permission to skip re-reading anything that has a known error, just to get around the problem.",
