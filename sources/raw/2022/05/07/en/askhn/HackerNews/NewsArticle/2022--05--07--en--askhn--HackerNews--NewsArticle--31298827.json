  "description": "I have a personal project I’ve been working on that is a desktop app with a UI that has some fairly complex data visualizations.<p>I’ve been using Electron because I know JS well and can leverage D3.<p>The problem I’m facing is that I sometimes go for months without working on it, and it feels like everyone I start up I’m running into some dumb JS/TS/Electron ecosystem issue that takes me a few hours to debug (if I don’t just give up first.)<p>What are some good modern tools/frameworks for building native Desktop apps? Bonus points for cross-platform support.",
