  "description": "It's no secret that the tech industry lends itself to operating in a way that can have negative impacts on the mental wellness of its workers. This industry has a ton of pressure around maintaining adherence to strict schedules and is very demanding of constant productivity. In my experience(as a neurodivergent person) there is also a fairly high presence of neurodivergent people drawn to working in the industry.<p>Do you feel like your neurodivergence is ever a boon in your job? Have you struggled with mental health while working in tech? Has a diagnosis and/or treatment helped? Do you have tips to share? And finally... Can Neurodiversity make us better hackers?",
