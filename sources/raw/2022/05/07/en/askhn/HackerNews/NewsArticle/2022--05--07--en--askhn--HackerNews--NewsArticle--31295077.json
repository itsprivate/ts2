  "description": "I’ve been “stuck” trying to make a decision for over a month. This decision is relatively important and will affect my life in the near term (12 months) but I don’t believe any option will result in drastically different long term effects.<p>I seem to be stuck in analysis paralysis; I spend many hours online casually gathering data and reading relevant articles. I’ve made lists, drawn up pros and cons, and even in a last ditch effort wrote a quick Ruby script to output an option thinking I could let that thing decide for me.<p>Alas, I’m still stuck. When you’re faced with an important decision where there doesn’t seem to be a clear “best” option, are there any concrete, systematic techniques you use to arrive at an answer?",
