  "description": "To clarify, I am not asking if I should learn <i>what</i> Docker is, but rather if I should learn &quot;Advanced Docker&quot; and how you'd go about learning it.<p>By advanced docker I mean especially the automatic deployments where CI builds the image, pushes it to a registry and then multiple instances around the world pick it up and update themselves either in AWS or any other service.<p>My main concerns are\n1) I don't know any good article on the topic (&quot;how-to&quot;, &quot;why&quot;),\n2) It feels like more and more companies are targeting CI and code distribution (Render, Fly.io, Terraform (I guess)),\n3) Docker is getting less &quot;open&quot; (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17804916),\n4) New alternatives are emerging (like nixos).",
