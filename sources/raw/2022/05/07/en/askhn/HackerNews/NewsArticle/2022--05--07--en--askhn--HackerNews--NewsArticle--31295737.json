  "description": "I became interested in the old 8-bit computers like Commodore 64, Apple II, ZX Spectrum, etc. And also on 16/32 bit machines like the Amiga line. There are some offers for such machines on eBay but I'm not sure in what condition they will arrive if I purchase from there. Do you know some place online specialized in reselling such old machines and accessories for them where I can be sure that what I purchase will be in a good working condition?",
