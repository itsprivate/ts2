  "description": "I’m currently in a job search phase, and have heard differing opinions from my peers about still using cover letters when applying to roles. I can understand using them in the beginning of your career since it can help differentiate you and bolster an empty resume. However, for reference I’m in my “mid” career with roughly 9 professional years under my belt.<p>Curious to hear if you’ve stopped using cover letters passed a certain point, or continue to use a tailored one for each role applying to.",
