  "description": "If we can make plant-based meat which is healthy for carnivores, should we give it to them? I was watching a video showing a komodo dragon eating a deer alive from back to front. The suffering of the deer was unimaginable. It makes me wonder if we should ever interfere?<p>Pros : reduce a lot of suffering. We do a lot to reduce human suffering, but don't animals also deserve a life without suffering.<p>Cons : No right to interfere with nature; knowing people, we will probably screw it up completely.<p>Thoughts?",
