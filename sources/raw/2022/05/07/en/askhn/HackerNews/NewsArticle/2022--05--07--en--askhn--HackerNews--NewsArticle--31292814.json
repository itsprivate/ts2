  "description": "Hi everyone.<p>My cofounder and I had been working on a startup for a little while and thought, you know, let's apply to YC. Since then we've killed that idea (for various reasons) but on Friday we got an invite to a YC interview. What should we do?<p>The current plan is just to say at the start of the interview &quot;Hey we pivoted to this new business, lets talk about that instead&quot;. It's quite a large pivot - basically we realised what we were working on was going to be too small and ultimately our traction dried up, so we looked at problems we'd had along the way and found something we were more passionate about and probably better suited to build. We have good (imo) traction on this new business, considering we've only been working on it for like 3 weeks.<p>Would love some advice here! Surely we can't be the first this has happened to!",
