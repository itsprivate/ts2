  "description": "I just got out of the new Dr Strange movie and the CGI is the worse I've ever seen.  I just don't know or understand what is happening.  Is it all related to Covid?  Is complicated tools plaguing the movie industry like it is web development?  As we progress further, websites are getting worse.<p>Spider Man No Way Home looked really bad in quite a few spots.  Just simple things like a person on a green screen look bad.  It's been taking me out of movies recently.  It's like no one is on location anymore.  I saw a trailer for the new Jurassic Park and it seems like where there in the desert just talking is on a green screen.<p>I rewatched the first Avengers (2012) movie just to make sure I'm not going crazy and it looks 100x better.  I can't even tell it's CGI in some of the city scenes.<p>Can't wait for the new Top Gun to get out of this CGI hell that's happening.",
