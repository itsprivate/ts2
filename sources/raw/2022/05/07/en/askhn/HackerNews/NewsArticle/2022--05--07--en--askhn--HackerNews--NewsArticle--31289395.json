  "description": "On your Facebook feed, you'll nowadays find questions that seem phrased in that dopamine-trigger kind of way to prompt a responsive comment, and you'll usually find a few people you know who have commented among the &quot;6.8M comments&quot;, thus placing it in YOUR feed.<p>I remember seeing an explanation as to why these exist - that the question-askers can harvest sort of useful information from the commenters.  Can anyone explain?  Or are there some good articles/explainers on this I can read and then link to?<p>(Also, anyone from Meta here who might want to consider the problem?)",
