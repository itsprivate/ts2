  "description": "Hi All, this is Shardul here - I am the co-founder of Videobug.<p>https://bug.video<p>We are super excited to share Videobug with you. Videobug records run time code execution so that developers can watch it line by line as frequently as they want, right in their IDE. It takes away the pain of recreating exact conditions that led to a bug and saves developer time in every bug squash.<p>Parth (my co-founder) and I have worked on multiple production grade applications in startups and enterprises.<p>We used Logrocket, Sentry, and Datadog for logging and found ourselves adding more logs after a bug is found.<p>Adding accurate logs required disciplined engineering and collaboration across teams. Time to connect these logs to what’s wrong in the code, took quite sometime.<p>Videobug logs everything automatically. We are super psyched to launch our offline version. We plan to launch a fully self hosted version in 4 weeks from now, which will allow you to record and replay code executions in your staging and production environments.<p>We are looking for product feedback.<p>Here is a 2 min demo explaining how to use Videobug.<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U53IQifMt54<p>Join our discord channel to share your feedback or in case you need support.<p>https://discord.gg/Hhwvay8uTa<p>P.S. Please note that we collect the following analytics data from your IDE: Your computer hostname, debugging events such as “started debugger”, “fetched exceptions” and “searched for code execution”.",
