  "description": "Hey all, I was inspired by the other thread to make a quick video demo of what an Absurdly Compatible Website may look like when implemented.<p>This one does have some JavaScript, but degrades gracefully and supports text-mode browsers, no-JS browsing, and all the classics like IE3 and NN3 and Lynx.<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-_yr31biGM<p>Kudos to anyone who can name all the browsers used in the demo, I think it's more than 20 different ones :)<p>You can also check out the site live at http://RocketScience.click or https://RocketScience.click, at least until it's hugged.<p>The framework for this is a static-dynamic hybrid site generator with full transparency and decentralizability, which I'm just preparing for this weekend's MIT Bitcoin Expo, so please let me know if you find any issues.<p>Code is on GitHub: https://www.github.com/gulkily/RocketScience",
