  "description": "1) Summary = RecipeHunt(<a href=\"http://recipehunt.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://recipehunt.app</a>) is a Recipe Search Engine that gives you the only 3 things that matter in my opinion: (a) Picture, (b) Ingredients, (c) Directions<p>2) Problem = Every recipe site is bloated(e.g. full of ads, long backstory). I just want to see 3 things: Picture, Ingredients, Directions.<p>3) Solution = Built a simple Recipe Search Engine that gives you only those 3 things.<p>4) Tech Stack = Vanilla HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, SQL (some JQuery). Frameworks are too complicated for me, so I just wanted to build with what I know.<p>5) Design<p>-Main Feed = Similar to Instagram Explore (Square Shaped Thumbnails).<p>-Categories = Filter by &quot;Country&quot; or &quot;Dish Type&quot;.<p>-Search Bar = Quickly go directly to a Recipe or Category.<p>-Recipe Page = Gives you only 1 Picture + Ingredients + Directions + Comments. Separated by tabs (I don't like scrolling).<p>-Paywall(for Spam) = I put up a paywall to prevent spamming (Stripe).<p>6) Content(Recipes) = I manually put in some initial recipes (posted a few for each Country/Dish Type). Challenge is to fill the site with enough recipes to make it useful. May look into Recipe API's and make sure I'm not violating any terms (give source credit in recipe page).<p>7) Conclusion = Just wanted to share this because I think it will solve my own problem (making it less painful to search recipes). Still a work in progress, but hopefully it may be useful to someone else as well.<p>Will happily welcome any feedback! Thanks!<p>-nsemikey",
