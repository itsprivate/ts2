  "description": "Not like drink at work, but after work.<p>I do that. After work I come home, relax and start coding my own projects. But while coding I open a bottle of expensive drink and I sip, little by little, usually I get buzzed. So the day after I need to revisit my code to see what I've done xD<p>How about you?",
