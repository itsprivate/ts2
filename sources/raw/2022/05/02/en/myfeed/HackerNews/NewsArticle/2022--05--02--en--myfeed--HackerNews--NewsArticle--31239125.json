  "description": "May is Mental Health Awareness Month. If you are suffering from depression, anxiety or are experiencing any sort of mental distress, please seek help.<p>The easiest way to find help is to search for &quot;therapist in {your city}&quot;. If you believe you need medication, you can ask your primary care physician for help and they can refer you to a psychiatrist.<p>If you're new to therapy, you should know that one of the most successful approaches to treating depression and anxiety is cognitive behavioral therapy. Be sure to ask your prospective therapist if they have received training in that approach.",
