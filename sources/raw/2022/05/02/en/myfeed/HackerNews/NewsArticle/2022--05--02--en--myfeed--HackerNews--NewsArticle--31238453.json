  "description": "Location: Albany, NY\n  Remote: Yes\n  Willing to relocate: Maybe\n  Technologies: Microcontrollers, C, C++, Python\n  Résumé/CV: contact me \n  Email: tim.t.fake@gmail.com<p>My professional background has been in software engineering. I spent 7 years as a software / network engineer. However, over the last 3 years I have been pivoting into the lower levels of analog circuits and embedded systems. I have been mentored by Chris Gammell of Analog Life LLC in circuit design and starting my own electronics business; Armatura Electronica. This experience has taught me a lot about what goes into a good circuit analysis, circuit design, circuit troubleshooting, schematic development, PCB layout, and what it takes to be a consultant.",
