  "description": "I created Memory Hammer to address the problem of accumulated reviews in Anki.<p>Since Memory Hammer uses an always on e-paper display we can review an Anki card as and when its due.<p>Although the concept of Memory Hammer was in my mind for several years, I managed to build it only now. As a PoC, it supports basic cards with plain text and I hope to improve it over time through user feedback.<p>Have you faced the problem of accumulated reviews with Anki? What's your current solution to address it, Would Memory Hammer be helpful to you?",
