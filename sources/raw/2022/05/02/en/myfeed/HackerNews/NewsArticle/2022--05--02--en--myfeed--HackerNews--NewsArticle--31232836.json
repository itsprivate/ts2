  "description": "~5 years Python, STEM non-cs degree that all recruiters tell me is “amazing.” For this reason (?) get interviews, 0/ many. People seem to like me at my current shitty job, and management likes that I am a good little slave. But people don’t ever take me seriously - always peg me as “long hair, don’t care.”<p>This <i>is</i> a cry for help, feel free to give advice, a job interview or just commiserate if you’re in the same boat.",
