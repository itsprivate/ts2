  "description": "I always wanted to learn &quot;C&quot; but never found an real-world application of what I cound make. On last Sunday, I needed to measure time of some tasks. So I wrote an terminal &quot;Stopwatch&quot; app.\nIt's my first application in C programming language, probably it is stupid and not efficient. If you mind, let me know, so I can learn more about C in real world.<p>https://github.com/ggtd/cstopwatch",
