  "description": "A buddy of mine and I have been hacking on an api for crypto called <a href=\"https://blocksend.co\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://blocksend.co</a>.<p>It's up and running and you can use it for all sorts of projects. One hack was allowing a web2 company to pay twitter followers with crypto from a dashboard, another was offering immediate washout on marketplaces.<p>To show other founders what we're up to with it, we've loaded up a couple hundred bucks on it, and you can withdraw just by entering your email or text at this link <a href=\"https://app.blocksend.co/hngiveaway\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://app.blocksend.co/hngiveaway</a>.<p>And if you want any help integrating or getting a key, let us know!",
