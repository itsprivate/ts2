  "description": "Hey HN,<p>Today, I'm announcing the public release of MVP of Rebudget, a personal finance app that I've been working on over the last 2 years.  Rebudget helps you create a budget and track your personal finances using the zero-based budgeting or the envelope method.  I originally started working on this mostly as a fun side project to experiment and see what I could do, but also as a potential Mint/YNAB replacement for myself (as well as my wife's spreadsheet!).<p>There is still a lot of work to be done (it may be a little rough around the edges in some places), but I'm excited about the challenges and work ahead.<p>I'm open to any questions or feedback that is provided. Thanks!",
