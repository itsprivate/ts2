  "description": "Karambol is an AI-powered travel guide. It works like a search engine and aims to provide relevant travel itineraries while matching one's travel preferences.<p>As a traveler, I'm quite frustrated by paper guides. Way too long to read! Plus, I feel the editors add new “must see” things every year just to justify the new edition (and the price). I'm also frustrated at travel blogs where storytelling is over-used.<p>I like having the “best of the best” places to visit and have help building my itinerary. I know many others do the same. This is why I started Karambol, which is a side project so far.<p>Any feedbacks are welcomed!",
