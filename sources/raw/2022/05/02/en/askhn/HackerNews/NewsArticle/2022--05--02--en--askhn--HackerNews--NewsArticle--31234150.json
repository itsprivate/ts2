  "description": "I've been contemplating the idea of moving over my accounts on various services to an email on my own domain (mail@pietro72ohboy.com instead of mail@gmail.com). Since this email will serve as a gateway to accessing (and recovering access if needed) for all services, I'd want it to be reasonably secure. I've tried to stick with services that allow an extra 2FA over the traditional username/password login and I'm currently using fastmail for this.<p>I'd like to go back to using a service like Migadu that offer a simple, standard mail account accessible through IMAP and SMTP. Would an account secured by a sufficiently powerful password be secure enough? Or is 2FA a must for such accounts.",
