  "description": "I really enjoyed the &quot;schedule explorer&quot; feature of google maps for public transport.<p>A typical use case for me would be to find the shortest available trip from A to B on a given day (when departure time was flexible), the first or last travel option of the day, or the frequency of a given connection.<p>Unfortunately, all good (google) things seemingly must come to an end, and the schedule explorer feature is being phased out from google maps.<p>Short of checking individual transporter's timetables, does anyone have an alternative that in particular addresses the above use cases? (Apple maps does not seem to have this option.)<p>Personally my main interest would be for Europe - even country-specific sites could be very helpful.",
