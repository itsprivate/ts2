  "description": "I am starting to take seriously finding a new job but don't want to rock the boat at my current place of work unnecessarily.<p>I am obviously going to be applying directly but I wanted to tell my LinkedIn network that I was at least open to new roles to see if anyone had anything. The problem is if I post anything, it'll be seen by my manager. We're connected on LinkedIn and Twitter so if I post anything overtly about searching, hell know and may cause issues I don't want yet.<p>Any advice on how to go about this? I don't care if my manager knows I'm unhappy, we've talked about it at length. I'm just not wanting everyone to know I've got one foot out the door in case there isn't anything better at this time.",
