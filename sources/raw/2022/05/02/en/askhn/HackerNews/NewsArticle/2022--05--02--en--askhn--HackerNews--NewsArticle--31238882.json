  "description": "I live in a 1-bedroom apartment in Seattle and was considering starting a small apartment garden. My goal is to grow maybe 1-2 vegetables that I can use for cooking.<p>I've seen many guides [1] but I was curious how practical it is to actually pull off. The long-term (maybe overly-ambitious) goal is to automate this process with watering and lighting.<p>[1]\n* https://www.homedepot.com/c/ai/apartment-gardening-tips/9ba683603be9fa5395fab90115e46ab9\n* https://www.thespruce.com/apartment-gardening-for-beginners-4178600\n* https://www.sustainablejungle.com/urban-gardens/apartment-gardening/\n* etc...",
