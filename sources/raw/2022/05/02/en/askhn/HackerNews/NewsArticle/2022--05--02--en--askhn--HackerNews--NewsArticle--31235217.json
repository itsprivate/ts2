  "description": "It's a simple question still there are many opinions out there. I want to ask this here as it is one of the most active comunities amongst programmers. So if you are a C++ developer who migrated to Rust or viceversa, please tell me what you miss or what you dont miss from your former programming language. Also any links to benchmarking or studies stating one is better than the other would be interesting.<p>Thanks in advance ;)",
