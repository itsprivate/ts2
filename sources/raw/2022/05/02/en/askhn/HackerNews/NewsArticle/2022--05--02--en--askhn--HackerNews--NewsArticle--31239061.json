  "description": "Hi Hackers,\nI am building a meme discord bot and i was wondering where you guys get good memes from...<p>Is there an api that:<p>(1) recommends memes based on user feedback: AI or not. something like a hosted &quot;for-you page&quot; that recommends memes based on likes or dislikes, image or even &quot;mood&quot;.<p>(2.) has reverse image/meme search capabilities.<p>(3.) has text or &quot;mood&quot; search capabilities (too).<p>(4.) has a wide array of templates, beyond the &quot;trendy&quot; ones.<p>(5.) (optional) has a simple way to create memes from text -  it's a discord bot, that removes the ability to graphically edit templates.<p>Paid or unpaid, i am interested.<p>Am i asking for too much, maybe? :)<p>Thanks in advance.",
