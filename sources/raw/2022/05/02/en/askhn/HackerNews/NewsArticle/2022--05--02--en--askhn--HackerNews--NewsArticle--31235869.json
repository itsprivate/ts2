  "description": "Gmail is ending its G Suite legacy soon, and I've set up my entire family on there with a custom domain. The cheapest option $6 (USD, presumably) / month / account is not affordable as by now we are already 8 users on our domain (and more might be coming!).<p>What's your experience with other email providers? I'm looking into something less expensive so I'm undecided between Fastmail and Tutanota (already have the free version).<p>What are your thoughts? Any experience with these providers with your own domain?",
