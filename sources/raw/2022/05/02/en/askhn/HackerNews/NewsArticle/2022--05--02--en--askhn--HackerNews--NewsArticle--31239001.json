  "description": "We regularly see the successful &quot;Who's hiring&quot; and &quot;Who wants to be hired&quot; threads here. I thought it could be interesting to introduce &quot;Who's investing&quot; threads. So let's give this a try. I'm sure there are many great angels/VCs on HN that could potentially see this.<p>Please state what sectors you invest in and at what stage (check size and global/US only could be helpful).",
