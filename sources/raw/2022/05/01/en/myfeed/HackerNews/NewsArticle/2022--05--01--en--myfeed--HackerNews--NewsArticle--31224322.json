  "description": "If you are planning to use SendGrid for sending newsletters or mass emails, go with &quot;Pro&quot; (starting at $90./month). The Pro level provides you with a dedicated IP address ascribed to your traffic.<p>Don't bother with &quot;Essentials&quot;, you will be assigned a shared pool of IP addresses, and will be blocked because of questionable activity by previous users of same IPs.<p>BTW SendGrid Tech. Support are excellent.<p>(I am a customer, I'm not profiting from this).",
