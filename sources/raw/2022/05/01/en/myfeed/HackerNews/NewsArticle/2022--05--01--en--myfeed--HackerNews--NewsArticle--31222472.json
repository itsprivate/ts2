  "description": "I am the founding team member of a small startup. I was thinking about using Linear as our project management tool. The UI/UX is amazing and I've heard great things about it which makes me want to try it out even more.\nThe problem is, since we are a very early stage startup, I don't think we'll be able to afford Linear for maybe the next 3 months or so ( India based so the USD to INR conversion makes it worse ). I can see linear has a very generous plan but the things I am worried about is the 250 issue limit, and the 150 MB file upload limit. \nIs anyone using Linear Free tier one and have you faced any crucial issues with using it?",
