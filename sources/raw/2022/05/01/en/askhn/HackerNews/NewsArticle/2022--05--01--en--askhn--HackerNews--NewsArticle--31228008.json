  "description": "About 14 years ago or so every now and then someone would come along with a plan to fix email, it was so common that in response there was a detailed boilerplate response that people would use to answer these plans, which was basically just a checklist of reasons why plans to fix email fail, with the particular reasons why the current plan would fail checked off.<p>At the end you generally put any further explication. I'm having a hard time finding that boilerplate any more, so does anyone have a copy?",
