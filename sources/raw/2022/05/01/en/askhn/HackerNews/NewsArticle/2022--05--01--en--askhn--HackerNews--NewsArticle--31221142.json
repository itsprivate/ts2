  "description": "My daughter will graduate next year and, having always been technically inclined, has indicated that she would like to pursue a career in some aspect of the technical industry. I think this is wonderful.\nHowever, having recognized the importance of your industry tragically late I feel like I am letting her down when she wants to discuss specifics, i.e. What do I think about the future of AI, which programming languages will remain relevant etc.\nI've started to regularly read here (often with a search page pulled up to research some of the terminology) and have begun subscribing to newsletters etc, but I'm wondering if anyone resources or pages they would recommend to help me better educate myself in her chosen field of interest. I am not seeking to be an expert, but I would love to be a somewhat informed sounding board as she switches into adulthood.",
