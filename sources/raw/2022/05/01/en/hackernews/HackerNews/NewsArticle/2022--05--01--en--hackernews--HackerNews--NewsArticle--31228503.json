  "description": "I have become addicted to/heavily reliant on food delivery apps throughout the pandemic as they are seemingly convenient. In reality, the food quality is subpar and seldom arrives on time. Also, these apps are money sinks, not to mention that the food is generally not the healthiest. Any tips/ideas on how to reduce or stop using them altogether? Thanks.",
