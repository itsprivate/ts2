  "description": "Greetings,<p>Is losing faith/hope in humanity something others experience as well? \nIs it due to the way i perceive things (i.e. my entourage)? \nAm I in a bubble and I don't see it? How do I get out? \nShould I <i>be</i> in a bubble to keep my sanity? \nHow do I build those filters?<p>Please let me know your thoughts and how you're handling it.<p>Things that are making me lose hope:<p>- climate change or how society/corporations/governments are destroying the environment and/or are barely doing anything. All I think about sometimes is how we'll begin to see famines spreading across poor countries until it's all too late... Yet Elon buying Twitter is still in the news till this day.<p>- social inequality is rising year on year. inflation is a killer for poor families that are barely making ends meet. Yet most corporations are announcing lots of profits and they barely give a sh*t about their workers.<p>- workers: all I hear is there's a shortage of workers. shortage, shortage, shortage. But they rarely talk about salaries and wages being so low.<p>- billionaires: ugh, enough about these megalomaniacs.<p>- media: it's feeding people rubbish all the time. All. The. Time.<p>- corruption: it's so wide spread, people have become desensitized. war... famines... I could go on...",
