  "description": "Hi all,<p>I _love_ Neovim. However, I think many parts of it could be easier to configure or understand, especially when it comes to LSPs. There's a ton of plugins that fill the gap, but some of them are sparse in documentation. There's also distributions like LunarVim that attempt to add a Doom Emacs-like layer above.<p>My approach is a bit different, simply giving an opinionated, modular, and documented configuration that an interested user can easily modify to their needs. It makes use of the most helpful plugins I've encountered to create the best experience I could muster while retaining an air of simplicity.<p>I hope this is helpful to someone out there!",
