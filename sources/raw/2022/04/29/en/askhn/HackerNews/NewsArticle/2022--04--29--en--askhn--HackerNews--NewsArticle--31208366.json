  "description": "EXAMPLE 1:<p>I customize and automate my workflow a lot. Basically I mod and tinker everything that I use to make it work differently and sometimes better. I write scripts that automate boring stuff, and Word VBA macros are my thing.<p>EXCEPT that nobody gives a $h!t about such skills. In my job, 99.9% of people just use what's available and don't bother changing things to make their workflow more convenient.<p>EXAMPLE 2:<p>Through practice and learning from the best speakers, I've improved my presentation skills over the years. From the moment I create a PowerPoint slide to the moment that I deliver the presentation. I create super advanced and professional slides and am confident when talking about my content in front of an audience.<p>EXCEPT that most people in my job (academia) don't even notice all the hard work that goes into my presentations and all the details. Their slides are either simple Beamer Latex, or $h!tty PowerPoint slides using Calibri as the default font, not symmetric, no attention to aesthetics whatsoever. And their presentations are super boring and not at all engaging or exciting.<p>I've been thinking about where/how I can put my skills in good use. I FEEL LIKE I'M NOT APPRECIATED for any of such skills.<p>PS: Maybe I shouldn't've used &quot;useless&quot; in the title, but by useless I mean not useful enough in your job to get you appreciated.",
