  "description": "I was curious, are there any risks/liabilities in buyers paying directly to sellers, instead paying into companies account and then having payouts.<p>As an example, if Patreon allowed Creators to connect their Stripe accounts and allowing the money to go directly there.<p>Is there a risk, if it came to &quot;returns&quot;? Making the company liable and not necessary having the money to cover some costs?<p>Or is it just to control the money flows?",
