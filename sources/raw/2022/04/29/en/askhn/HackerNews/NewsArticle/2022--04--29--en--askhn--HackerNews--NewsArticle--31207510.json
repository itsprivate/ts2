  "description": "I've been recently interested and am getting started in the server and network world, their technologies and architectures that are out there. I've been reading and getting hands-on on REST APIs to Docker and serverless. Still, each day I come up with more doubts and the more I read the more I realize this universe is huge.<p>I wanted to come to you to ask:\n 1) If you were to get in the server world all over again, what advice would you give yourself? What would you do differently?\n 2) Which technologies do you think are worth starting with, and which do you think bring the most value today in production?\n 3) I'm interested in handling big volumes of data. Is there an architecture/hardware you'd recommend, or any particular insight you'd like to share on this?<p>If you have any good reads or videos on this, they are more than welcome, and I'd appreciate them.\nI like to think that we can learn from each others experience. Hopefully one day I will share what I've learnt in this path to help people who are in my current position.",
