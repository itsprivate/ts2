  "description": "Hello Denizens of Hacker News,  a topic that has been on my mind a lot recently is how to effectively manage technical debt.\nAs a veteran developer who has worked for a variety of companies I have mostly seen tech debt handled poorly, even to the point of developers being penalized by management for not working quickly enough. I wanted to ask… What are the most common types of tech debt you’ve seen in your companies? How do you prioritize dealing with tech debt so that the team stays productive?",
