  "description": "Today, with Robinhood, Webull, and etc there are many people who have their own blockage account and they manage it themselves. Many times they want to buty a new stock or sell some of what they have to buy another. NOTE: THIS IS NOT ABOUT WHAT TO BUY!!! THEY ALREADY MADE THAT DECISION. However, they don't know what to sell and when to sell to minimize the tax penalty while mitt some specific criteria. for instance the new stock be 50% of the portfolio or other criteria.<p>To see if this is a problem I created a questionnaire. It takes about four minutes to fill it. Would be great if you can help me to have a better picture of the problem.<p>Thanks.<p>here is the link:\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/TS93GD5",
