  "description": "I do not understand why people put up their rental units on AirBnB. I've tried this past year, and I make so much more money just renting the property to long term tenants (Or even short term tenants who rent by the month). The prices that airBnB suggest are below what I would charge a monthly tenant. Throw in random cancellations, scammers, and how much work it is to manage a property that you're renting to multiple people each month, and I simply do not understand who chooses to use AirBnB outside of vacation destinations.",
