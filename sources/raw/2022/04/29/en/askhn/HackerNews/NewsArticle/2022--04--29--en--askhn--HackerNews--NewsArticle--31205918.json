  "description": "Their launch tagline was &quot;Open source alternative to Twilio&quot;. \nI just took a look at their repository(https://github.com/plivo/plivoframework) and it looks like it hasn't been updated since 2015 and the documentation has been down for long time(https://groups.google.com/g/plivo-users/c/ZuImvGKhnno/m/Uj-109PQCQAJ). I couldn't find any announcement that they have become closed source. I think I might have missed a conversation/announcement regarding this.",
