  "description": "After reading about the `git.io` deprecation, I see that Github recommend using another URL shortener service.<p>But I'm wondering, why would you use such a service? I know Twitter and LinkedIn automatically shortens the URLs you post with a service they own that is completely integrated with their social network.<p>Twitter do this because the length of a tweet is limited. LinkedIn do this for tracking I guess?<p>But let's assume you're not Twitter or LinkedIn or any major social network. What are the pros to relying on such services?<p>The cons I see are:<p><pre><code>  - hide the real website behind an URL\n  - adds an extra redirection/DNS query\n  - hard to remember URL based on a hash\n</code></pre>\nScientific papers referencing shortened URLs is pretty shocking to me for those reasons. But, I must just be missing the pros, right?",
