  "description": "My son has been learning Scratch and expressed interest in doing more involved programming. Rather than dipping him in the cesspool of modern web development, I'd love to introduce him to programming via a RAD tool like VB6 or Delphi.<p>Is there a good modern equivalent? The closest I can think of is Windows Forms but even that has a lot longer ramp-up compared to VB6.",
