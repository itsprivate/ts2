  "description": "I recently attempted to log into a new Firefox instance with my Firefox account. As expected, I received an email with a verification code from accounts@firefox.com to my gmail account as part of the login flow.<p>This email was flagged by gmail. Above the body of the message, gmail inserted a scary looking red banner with the following text:<p>This message seems dangerous\nSimilar messages were used to steal people's personal information. Avoid clicking links, downloading attachments, or replying with personal information.<p>A link with the text &quot;Looks safe&quot; was presented (which I did click).<p>I made sure to check all the headers in the original message, and everything looked correct.",
