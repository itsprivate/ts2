  "description": "Good morning, we are working to migrate our microservices to containers by the end of the year.<p>How do developers work with containers in their local development environment? What workstation are you using? What IDE? What kind of software are you running locally? Is it even necessary to have all developers working with containers locally?<p>We are going to be using OpenShift and Podman.<p>I am part of the team leading the charge. We will eventually have to roll this out to a couple hundred developers and what to get an idea of what people are doing.<p>Thank you!",
