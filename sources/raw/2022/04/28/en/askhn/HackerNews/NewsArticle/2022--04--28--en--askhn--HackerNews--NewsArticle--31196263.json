According to this article[0] it's still in beta, but no mention of a proper launch date for when it comes out of beta.<p>Anyone have an official launch date so I can prepare to use it ASAP?<p>(I don't want to try their beta version BTW)<p>[0] https://protonmail.com/blog/proton-drive-early-access/",
