  "description": "Hello all,\nI am a current Java backend engineer, but I am taking an OS course and I am really enjoy it.<p>I am still very junior (YOE 1.25) but I am thinking of making a job jump to a systems programming SWE position.<p>I know Microsoft and Apple have positions obviously doing OS stuff, but any other companies I should consider?  I think my preference would to be a bit higher than embedded engineering, but I wouldn't rule those out completely.<p>I should mention I have experience (in my free time, not work experience) in C/C++/Rust/Go.  I don't do any objective-C or Swift so I don't know if Apple would be an option.<p>Thanks!",
