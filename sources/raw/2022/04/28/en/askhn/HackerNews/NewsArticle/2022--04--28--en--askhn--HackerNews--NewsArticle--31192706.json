  "description": "I need to deliver a technical user guide for field technicians to follow for configuring some devices. The current solution is a word doc which requires some brain power to fill in appropriate values (naming, IP, etc) as you progress in the steps.<p>I'd like to replace this with some kind of self-contained HTML where they can fill in the &quot;variables&quot; at the top and have it auto-generate throughout the doc.  This is pretty simple with HTML/JS, but the code can get messy if not done right.<p>Is there some framework like ReadTheDocs where I can easily write out RsT or Markdown, inserting variables with jinja2 (as an example) that can be input in an input field, and have it dynamically render live in-browser (which I believe then rules Sphinx out)?",
