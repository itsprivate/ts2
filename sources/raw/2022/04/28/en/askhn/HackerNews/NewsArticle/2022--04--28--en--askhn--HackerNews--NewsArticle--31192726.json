  "description": "I've been noticing a trend lately of US companies hiring outside of the US to save money. I'm not talking about outsourcing, I'm talking about hiring capable full time engineers in places like Canada, Central America and Europe. (The first two have no time zone issues; Europe is manageable for East coast companies). Some companies still hire in the US, but prefer low cost of living regions.<p>Isn't that worrisome for US based people? I'm wondering what will be the impact on US salaries, esp in tech.",
