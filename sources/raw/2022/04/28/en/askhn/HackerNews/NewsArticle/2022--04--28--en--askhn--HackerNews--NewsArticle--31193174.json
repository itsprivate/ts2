  "description": "I have been lurking HN for years, sometimes submitting articles yet very rarely engaging in comments. What stops me from commenting, and from reacting to other people's comments, is the fact that the chances of starting a conversation are so low (i.e. the person I am replying to may never know I wrote something, and if they somehow do reply I'm probably not going to see it unless I explicitly go back to check).<p>Is there anything I'm missing?",
