  "description": "Hi HN, I've seen plenty of Kubernetes clusters out there, but none met my definition of &quot;production-grade&quot;.<p>I don't mean &quot;is it used in production&quot; - most of them are, but are still a work-in-progress and missing some configuration such as cross-AZ replication (most common), auto-scaling nodes, disaster recovery etc.<p>Are you satisfied with your cluster? is it mostly &quot;done&quot; or do you still have a large (3+) DevOps team working on it? for how long?",
