  "description": "So, I really don't like rants, but I had to do it. First I am mad on myself, not checking it before, but also mad on Apple, again. Yes, I was &quot;forced&quot; to switch from my old Android phone to something newer, and yes, I use both platforms - Windows and OS X (M1 MBA), and I had before an iPhone (old 4S), so I wanted to give it a try, picked an iPhone 13 and start using it.<p>And then, just last week, I realized on my vacation, shooting some videos, that you can't pause the video recording. And I went crazy, like really, in 2022. where an Chinese Android phone for 150 USD can do that, the mighty flagship of Apple can't do that, and you know what else can't do? For some reason, iPhone 13 can't switch from back to front camera while recording.<p>In the era of TikTokers and vlogers, this can't be done..<p>Yeah, my rant is over, now I listen your rants :) Thank you!",
