  "description": "I feel like forum culture is to blame for creating the scenario where a definite answer = intelligence (news.ycomb is very much a place where this happens).<p>Which has created a scenario where people think science contains truths as opposed to approximations and best guesses.<p>It's kinda sad because it bleeds into everything now - it's no longer acceptable for someone to be like &quot;well let's think about it together.. &quot; and have any discourse.<p>Instead it just paved the way for garbage like CNN and FOX to sell absolutism to idiots.",
