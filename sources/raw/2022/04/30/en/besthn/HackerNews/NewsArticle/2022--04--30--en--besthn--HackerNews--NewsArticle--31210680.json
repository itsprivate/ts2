  "description": "Hi HN! We're a bootstrapped team of 4 and have been building Radiopaper for around 16 months alongside other full-time, part-time, and consulting jobs.<p>I wanted to highlight a couple of the unique characteristics of Radiopaper that may not be immediately apparent when browsing <a href=\"https://radiopaper.com/explore\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://radiopaper.com/explore</a><p>* It's possible to interact with Radiopaper entirely by email, and never log-in interactively. The notification emails contain context that explains that if you reply to the email, your message will be published on <a href=\"https://radiopaper.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://radiopaper.com</a><p>* The key mechanism that makes Radiopaper different from other social networks, and more resistant to trolling and abuse, is that messages are not published until the counterparty replies or accepts your comment. You can read more about this in our manifesto at <a href=\"https://radiopaper.com/about\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://radiopaper.com/about</a><p>The technical stack is a Vue/TypeScript app talking to an API backend written in Go, running on Cloud Run, and using Firestore for persistence, Firebase Auth for authentication.<p>Email processing is handled through the Gmail API hooked up to a Cloud Pubsub notification which triggers another Cloud Run service. Outbound emails go through SendGrid.<p>The whole stack &quot;scales-to-zero&quot;, and on days that we have a few hundred active users, we're still under the free limits of Firebase Hosting, Cloud Run &amp; Firestore, so this has allowed us to operate for a long time without funding or revenue. Our overall burn rate is around $40/month, mostly from the smattering of other SaaS offerings we use: Sentry, Mixpanel, Github &amp; SendGrid.<p>Dave &amp; I discuss our tech stack in a little more detail in this  conversation:\n<a href=\"https://radiopaper.com/conversation/4PsvfxLX2Q5NHLBs8nuN\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://radiopaper.com/conversation/4PsvfxLX2Q5NHLBs8nuN</a><p>The team (myself, daave, davidschaengold, youngnh) will be around to answer any questions!",
