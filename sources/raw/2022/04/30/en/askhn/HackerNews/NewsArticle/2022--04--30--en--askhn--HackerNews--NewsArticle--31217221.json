  "description": "I have a strong desire to start a SaaS company, so I followed the usual advice of bringing myself to the cusp of a problem domain — twice(!) over the past 13 years — only to come to the realization after considerable investment that any products on the edge would have limited market appeal because both problem domains likely had their heyday 30+ years ago.<p>I don't regret the time spent as I'm now something of a domain expert in one of the two and I have some neat hobbies to pursue in my down-time.<p>With all of this being said, here's the question…<p>*** How can I find problems other people want/need to have solved without diving all the way in or fundamentally changing myself as a person? ***<p>I have a healthy social life, but my interests and daily activities don't really align with my peers. Outside of the two aforementioned problem domains, I don't have any itches to scratch, but the strong desire to start an SaaS company remains.",
