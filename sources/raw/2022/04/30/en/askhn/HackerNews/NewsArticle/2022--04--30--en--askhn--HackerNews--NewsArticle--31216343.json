  "description": "HN,<p>I have been working on displaying various stats about a git repo and associated CI jobs such as who is changing what, when jobs fail,etc... I don't mind doing this from scratch but I am surprised there isn't something out there that does this already.<p>Do you have any tips on how to do this? Would static site generators be useful? D3.js too much?",
