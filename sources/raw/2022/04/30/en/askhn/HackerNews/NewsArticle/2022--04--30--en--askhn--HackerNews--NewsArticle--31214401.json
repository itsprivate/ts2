  "description": "I am trying to compare how a number of companies did in the past quarter versus Q1 2020, Q1 2019, etc. I understand this information is publicly available through 10Qs, etc.<p>However, easy to use tools like Yahoo Finance only show the past 4 or 5 quarters of information, which is mind boggling short to me. What tools can I use to see quarterly financials (easily and in an standarised table) that goes beyond 4 quarters?",
