  "description": "Anyone interested in a PCB that combines esp32cam, portable router, and some motor controllers for IoT control of things such as rovers, drones, etc...?\nI see that there isn't much out there on how to do live data/video streaming from cheap esp32cams to a personal public domain, or how to do it with portable routers for true &quot;remote&quot; control without a middle man like Raspberry Pi or PC for port forwarding.\nThinking about making PCBs and providing code to control through Google Form so that anyone can control it over WiFi.<p>Any thoughts would be appreciated!",
