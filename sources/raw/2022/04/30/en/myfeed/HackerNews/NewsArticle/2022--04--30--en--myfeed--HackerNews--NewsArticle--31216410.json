  "description": "Today I got an email from Upwork telling me that I now have to pay a 5% fee on top of the payments to freelancers.<p>What cought my eye is that I can reduce that 5% to 3% if I pay via bank account billing instead of credit card.<p>Is that because Visa is charging 2% for every transaction?<p>Isn't that insanely hight? Do they provide anything in return? Or is it just because they have somewhat of a monopoly?<p>Upwork is processing about $1B of payments per year. While still not making any money on it.<p>Meanwhile, Visa is taking $20M out of that?",
