  "description": "We recently plugged in GPT-3 to our software which can record / transcribe / search and share meetings. \nAnd the quality of the meeting minutes outputted is just baffling.<p>GPT-3 understands what a discussion revolves around - even if the subject matter is only mentionned once - and summarizes it really efficiently. It lays out the different topics and always puts forward the next steps.<p>Linked is a quick example on one of my conversations with a company in the Philippines.<p>An amusing bug was that if for whatever reason no to little transcription was outputted, GPT-3 would insult the participants (is it trained on Reddit??).<p>The danger would be if GPT-3 misinterprets something and this then gets into the formal decision process of a company. However I haven't seen it yet after 1 month of live production and a little more than a hundred of internal calls tried out on.<p>Check it out it's free to try out:\n<a href=\"https://cutt.ly/welcome_to_spoke\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://cutt.ly/welcome_to_spoke</a>\n:)",
