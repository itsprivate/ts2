  "description": "Hey HN, I believe that easy proof of ownership is an unsolved problem that is one of the blockers towards mass adoption of NFTs. Walletsy is an exploration of my beliefs.<p>Walletsy makes proof of ownership easy and risk free. Get instantly verified in all your servers (that have Walletsy set up) in just a few seconds.<p>Server managers use Walletsy in order to gate their community and run raffles with just a few clicks.<p>Users just connect their Wallet and Discord to Walletsy once, and then no more headaches. They can also link their Twitter, add multiple Wallets and remove them.<p>Looking forward to the feedback.",
