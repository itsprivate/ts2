  "description": "I'm a manager of a small team of developers working on a desktop application that was first released in the mid 90s. As was the rage back then, the application was written in C++ and MFC.<p>Since then, the codebase has grown to over a million lines of code with huge amounts of functionality. Although the developers are generally good coders, there has been limited oversight on architectural decisions made.<p>I'm trying to get an overview of the suitability of the current codebase for continued development into the future. Are there any companies or services providing independent insights into architecture, extensibility and technological debt of an existing codebase?",
