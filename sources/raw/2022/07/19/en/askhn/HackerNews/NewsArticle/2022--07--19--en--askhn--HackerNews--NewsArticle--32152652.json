  "description": "I am a FAANG tech worker bee (experience as software engineer, tech lead and engineering manager) who is growing significantly tired of the corporate rat race, and the fact that I have really no control over pretty much anything I do all day at work, I am at the whims of corporate politics that make every effort I spend objectively pointless, if it wasn't for the fact that it pays my salary. As such, I am looking to start some sort of pet project to satisfy my craving for ownership.\nI think over the years I gained a unique perspective when it comes to personal finance, financial independence and passive investments, working in tech, tech compensations, startups and equity, and similar topics (a few snippets of this &quot;wisdom&quot; are available in my other comment down below). I routinely get calls from friends/acquaintances/ex coworkers asking for advice regarding one of these topics.<p>I am trying to understand if it would be worth starting a blog that covers these subjects. The goal would be to eventually monetize this in some way (ads, affiliate, consultations, â€¦) just so that I could consider it worth my time.<p>Do you think this could be a viable strategy, or am I embarking on a sad journey that after thousands of hours spent creating content would leave me with nothing valuable to show for? A brutally honest answer would be highly appreciated, since I haven't started yet.<p>Thanks",
