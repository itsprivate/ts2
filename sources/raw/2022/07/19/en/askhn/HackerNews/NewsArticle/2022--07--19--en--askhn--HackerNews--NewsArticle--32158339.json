  "description": "I got billed by a medical facility for providing services that I literally never got on a certain date this year. The last time I visited them was years ago.<p>They never billed my insurance provider (it seems they never got my new info), so i canâ€™t dispute through them.<p>After talking with them on the phone, they just tell me they are sure they billed the right person. And insist i pay.<p>Anyone had this situation before? What would you do? If this was just a trivial $20 bill I would pay it but it is hundreds.",
