  "description": "My last job burnt me out so hard that I needed to leave without finding another job.<p>I've pieced my mind back together in the mean-time (I'm no longer depressed/suicidal), but I still have severe anxiety issues and haven't worked in four years.<p>The nervousness that results from the anxiety tanks every interview I do, and I never even get to the technical stage (leaving me unable to even display the fact that I do actually know what I'm doing).<p>I really have no clue how to get back into things.",
