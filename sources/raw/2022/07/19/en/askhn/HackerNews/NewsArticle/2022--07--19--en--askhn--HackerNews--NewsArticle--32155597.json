  "description": "I last interviewed almost five years ago and at the time I was mostly asked leet code in the interview portions. I’m interviewing again now and it seems nearly every company I’m talking to has a system architecture question as part of the screen (in some cases one ML system and one Software system).  I’m generally good at architecture but I’m used to solving these problems over long time horizons by doing detailed research. Are there any good resources or practice problems for doing these in 45 minute spitball sessions? I think it’s a dramatically different skill from regular system design and I’m not entirely sure how to approach it. I also would like to practice a wider variety of systems because my personal experience is a bit heavy on mobile and I feel I’m likely to get asked mostly server specific questions.",
