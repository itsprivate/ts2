  "description": "For me personally, the answer is clearly to go for a run. In fact, I would say it worked about 100% of the time for me over the last 10 years. It allowed me to endure and crush through pretty much every challenge or blocker I hit, personal and work-wise. Whether those were challenges/splitting with co-founders, raising capital, finding a solution for technical/product problems, or getting through the intense process of my startup being acquired. Every time I come back from a run I either have &quot;the answer&quot;, &quot;next step&quot; or at the very least the motivation to keep trying (harder).<p>So tell me, what is it for you that gets your mind? unblocked?",
