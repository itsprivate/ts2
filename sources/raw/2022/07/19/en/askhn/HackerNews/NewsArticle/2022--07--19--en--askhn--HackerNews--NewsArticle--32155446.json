  "description": "I'm a solo founder of a company. I have never created a LinkedIn account for myself or the company for a number of reasons:<p>1. I value my privacy and data.<p>2. As a company with no employees, it doesn't make much sense to have a company page (other than &quot;marketing&quot; / &quot;discoverablity&quot; points).<p>My company is doing well (high six figures) and it has been running over five years now.<p>I have been asked once during a sales/demo call why I didn't have any online presence, LinkedIn, etc. Essentially, &quot;How can my business trust you? I don't know anything about you...&quot;<p>This got me thinking about starting a LinkedIn account solely for a &quot;presence,&quot; but it feels wrong to me. How did other founders tackle this?",
