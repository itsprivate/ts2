  "description": "My website -- http://xordle.xyz -- has just disappeared from DNS. It's been working fine for months.<p>My registrar is Google Domains; there's no errors reported in the DNS settings or anywhere else. But Google's own DNS query at https://dns.google/query?name=xordle.xyz returns a status code 3 -- NXDOMAIN, or no such domain.<p>I tried transferring to a different registrar but it can't be transferred on account of it &quot;not existing&quot;. I tried using Google Support; they weren't helpful in the slightest.<p>Do I have any options aside from just getting a new domain name if it doesn't resolve itself quickly?",
