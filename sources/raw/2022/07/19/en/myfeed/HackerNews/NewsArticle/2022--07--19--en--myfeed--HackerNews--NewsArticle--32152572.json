  "description": "I work as a Paramedic for a large regional ambulance service in the UK. Too many of the calls we attend to with blue lights are not emergencies. This is a problem because it puts genuine emergencies at risk due to long waits and degrades staff morale. The long waits are a national crisis. Yesterday I attended to someone on the floor for 5+hrs before we picked her up.<p>There are many factors to this but I would like to identify the issue of defensive medicine. Defensive medicine refers to the practice of recommending a diagnostic test or medical treatment that is not necessarily the best option for the patient, but mainly serves to protect the clinicians.<p>I believe this is happening with out national medical advice line '111'. It is a common held belief amongst my colleagues that '111' is too risk adverse.<p>It's a long shot asking HN but can one implement a smarter triage system? One that filters out the junk so ambulances are kept for real emergencies.",
