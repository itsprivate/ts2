  "description": "I am unsure whether to post this as it exposes potential harm to millions of accounts...<p>Nike.com apparently lets you take over an account by calling in and verifying the email address and phone number associated with the account.<p>My account was just hacked, someone called in and used my information to change the email address to my name @outlook.com (same as my gmail account).<p>Their only solution was to delete my account.
