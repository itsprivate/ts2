  "description": "I have read every productivity book out there. GTD, the Rapid planning method by Tony Robbins, The seven habits of highly successful whatever… all of them, and I have benefitted a lot from each of them. But all of them aim at getting your projects done.<p>That’s a bad idea. Your projects get done, and now what? As a productive individual, with what are you left? With my recent approach to things that took my first startup Proxies API to profitability, I realized that aiming productivity tools at projects were not helping me.<p>Instead, I aim to build habits.<p>Because mastery of productivity tools and methods don’t build your confidence, habits develop your confidence. You are only as confident as your habits. Tweet that!<p>I, in my psyche, don’t see that I have to build a successful startup in Proxies API. It appears like that to other people. For me, I have built two habits, which, in turn, create a successful startup. The habits are:<p>a) Make the product better every day<p>b) Write every day<p>I have never really missed a day; that’s where my confidence comes. Even if Proxies API fails for some reason, it is not a huge setback, because I got my boys, which is this relentless chugging away at making the product better and writing about it every single day.<p>I feel this is the proper application of all productivity techniques. If you subscribe to this view, here is a check that you can do at the end of every month to see if you are on the right track.<p>What habit have you built in the last 30 days? Which you have done every single day?<p>What pattern are you planning to develop in the next 30 days?<p>The answers to these questions can be quite telling because they predict the success or failure of your projects or startups. Also, they anticipate your confidence level.<p>The author is the founder of Proxies API (https://www.proxiesapi.com/), a proxy rotation api service.<p>This article originally appeared here: https://www.proxiesapi.com/blog/Throw-Away-Your-Productivity-Techniques.php",
