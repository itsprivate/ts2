  "description": "Hey HN! We're the creators of Sieve API (<a href=\"https://www.sievedata.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.sievedata.com</a>) and we recently built this fun site that folks can play around with. Frontend is built with NextJS + Tailwind UI and backend is our API.<p>It uses ffmpeg in the browser to transcode an uploaded video, chop it to 5 seconds, and then send it to our API endpoint which detects and tracks objects in the video. You can then &quot;select&quot; any object and track it over the video.<p>We thought it'd be a fun thing for the community to play around with while also showing the power of video object tracking!",
