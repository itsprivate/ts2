  "description": "If I want to architect a peer-to-peer application that needs to achieve consensus, what are some of the provably correct protocols/algorithms?<p>I am not interested in &quot;web3/crypto&quot; solutions. Just pure theoretical papers that describe how one might go about solving this problem from first principles. The closest analogy would be Two Phase Commit for distributed databases.<p>If you can cite the papers or provide links that would be great.",
