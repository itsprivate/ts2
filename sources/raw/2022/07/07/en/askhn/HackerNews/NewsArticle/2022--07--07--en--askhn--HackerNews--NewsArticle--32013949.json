  "description": "I am old and overeducated.  I grew up poor with uneducated parents, after high school I had to get a job.  Later in life I put myself through college all the way to an MBA from a top school.<p>All my life I have wanted to be an entrepreneur but while I started a few companies, they all failed.<p>Over the years I have heard here and there various versions of &quot;Attitude is more important than knowledge&quot; and each time I was furious, since I have invested a lot of time and money into acquiring knowledge. Alas I am starting to suspect that I was wrong all along.<p>While &quot;some&quot; knowledge is essential in business, &quot;attitude&quot; triumph knowledge when it comes to entrepreneurship, and business in general, by orders of magnitude.<p>So, what does HN think?<p>And how can I leverage my wealth of knowledge to become a successful entrepreneur?",
