  "description": "Headphones are all the rage nowadays, but how does it compare to a roughly equally good set of stereo?<p>I can see that headphones are more popular due to practical reasons, like portability and not disturbing your neighbors. But if those didn't matter, what would you actually choose?<p>Personally, headphones tend to numb (ie damage) my ears, even if just a tad bit, unless I have it at minimum volume. And I'm definitely <i>not</i> the kinda person who cranks up the volume at all (that's how I can even detect the slight damage to my ears).<p>Stereo, on the other hand, I can have it much louder without any detectable damage. Plus, my favorite thing about playing music via the stereo is that it actually moves/shakes the physical space around me, which makes it even more enjoyable to rock out/party with.<p>I much prefer having the beat in the environment rather than just my ears/head.<p>What are your thoughts about this?",
