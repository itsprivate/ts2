  "description": "We all know that sometimes having a good idea/service/product is not enough to make a successful business.<p>Sometimes businesses have to shut down due to not having enough users to cover their costs and sometimes (probably the saddest) when they get acquired by a company that just wants the talent and they shut down products.<p>I'm curious to hear about the ideas/products/services that people like the most but had to shut down and if there are any stories on why they shut down...<p>If there are enough people that loved such ideas/products/services, it might be worth it for someone else to reconsider, and having this strong and active community seemed like the right place to ask.",
