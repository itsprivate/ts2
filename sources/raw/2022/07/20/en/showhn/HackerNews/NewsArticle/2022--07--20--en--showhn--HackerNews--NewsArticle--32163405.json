  "description": "Hi there,<p>The app basically offers a handy user interface on top of Google's PageSpeed Insights API. It allows you to analyze URLs in bulk and save the reports for later references. Also, you can regenerate the saved reports for fresh results.<p>I called this functionality &quot;Automatic Checklists.&quot;<p>The app offers &quot;Manual Checklists&quot;, too. Those are exhaustive checklists with items in the form of &quot;tasks&quot;. The idea is for those tasks to model real-life JIRA tickets, which will be very useful for interns and junior developers.<p>As a start, there are two manual checklists, &quot;Front-End Checklist&quot; and &quot;NextJs SEO Checklist.&quot;<p>Any feedback is very welcome :)<p>PS. I'm a JS full-stack developer and blogger from Bulgaria, so I'm not a native English writer.",
