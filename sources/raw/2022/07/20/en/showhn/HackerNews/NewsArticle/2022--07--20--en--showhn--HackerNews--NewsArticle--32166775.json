  "description": "This is the first thing I've made in a while - it's a simple service that lets you make a neat little blog.<p>You can add custom HTML/JS/CSS, posts can be formatted with markdown, and every site gets an RSS feed. It also has server-rendered social card images, and once a post is published, you can see basic stats about how it's doing.<p>You can try it out for free, and then once you're ready to make your site public, it's just a $20 one-time payment to keep the lights on.<p>Let me know what you think :)",
