  "description": "After being frustrated with the budget and learning curve requirements of the big names in the Virtual Production field, I decided to create my own all-in-one platform designed with beginners and less-technical folk in mind.\nIt takes complicated tasks in other engines and makes them two-click solutions.  And, with the free companion mobile app, you can track cameras, scan your sets, and (coming soon) do full body motion capture!<p>There's a ton more features that I'm super proud of, and I'm open to any and all feedback!\nThanks!",
