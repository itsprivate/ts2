  "description": "Seems like any time our engineering teams find a useful tool or service that could solve a lot of our headaches, we have to go through a long, arduous process of getting finance and legal to enter into a service contract.  Every vendor seems to have their own idiosyncrasies that make this a nightmare.  And it doesn't matter how close to free the service is.  As long as there's a non-zero cost involved, it involves a giant roll of red tape.<p>Are there any startups out there that are trying to make this process easier?  Like, maybe have a central vendor with whom the contract is held, and then you get access to a whole bunch of associated vendors with standard terms, without having to negotiate each one?",
