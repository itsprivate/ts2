  "description": "I don't want any messages to be able to arrive that do not permit me to immediately respond back on an email thread instead of the abysmal hellscape that is &quot;Help Centers&quot; - and I want the difficulty of interacting with service providers that only have their own cookie-cutter solutions instead of just answering emails like a normal human to lead me to gradually move away from those service providers.<p>Other than just teleporting the incoming emails into the phantom zone with a &quot;noreply&quot; regex email filter, is there a better way to achieve justice in this manner?",
