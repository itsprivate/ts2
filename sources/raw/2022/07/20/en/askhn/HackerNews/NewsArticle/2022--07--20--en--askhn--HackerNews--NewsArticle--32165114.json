  "description": "I have an oculus VR headset account and if I transfered it to a meta account, it might violate some GDPR regulations. I'm trying to get some information.<p>I tried to look up how to send an email to the data protection officer (DPA), or fill in an online form but failed. I tried to fill in the form at: https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/627537721877560<p>It proposes a security question that never appears. I've tried different browsers and security settings. Nothing works, maybe I'm overlooking something and others can make it work. Please, let me know.<p>The only way I found so far to contact Meta data protection officer, is to send an actual letter to the address:<p><i>Meta Platforms Ireland Limited</i><p><i>FAO: Privacy Operations</i><p><i>4 Grand Canal Square</i><p><i>Grand Canal Harbour</i><p><i>Dublin 2, Ireland</i><p>The only option I have at the moment is to send a certified letter to the above address. I know this seems over the top, but it would help the privacy commission in my country if I could show the response (or lack of response) of the DPA.",
