  "description": "People usually use calendars to schedule meetings or plan what to do where &quot;in the future&quot;.<p>What I like to do is fill all 24 hours of every day in my calendar with what I did (rounded up to 15min blocks) so that I can check in the future. I plan days in advance like others, but as I live each day, I make sure all the calendar records &quot;in the past&quot; are accurate.<p>People around me don't seem to do this. I'm wondering if I'm alone in the universe, or if my habit is a niche one that I cannot find similarities offline in my life, but can on developer communities like HN.",
