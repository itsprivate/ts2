  "description": "Hi HN,<p>I recently saw that this book was available on Audible. I prefer audio-reading books these days to prevent straining my eyes. But I was afraid if I would be missing out on any diagrams etc from the physical book if I opt for the audio version.<p>Has anyone gone through the audio version of the book? Would you recommend it?",
