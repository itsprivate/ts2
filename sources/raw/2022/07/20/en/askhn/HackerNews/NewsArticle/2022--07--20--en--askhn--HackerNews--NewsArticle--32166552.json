  "description": "Given the reversal of Roe V Wade, we've seen a great deal of doctor-ordered drugs refused to be vended by pharmacists due to &quot;religious reasons&quot;. A variety of these drugs treat symptoms like lupus, Crohn's, and others. They do share a side-effect, in that they can cause a spontaneous abortion.<p>Combined with that, are places like CVS that put out an order to all pharmacists to withhold these drugs. https://newrepublic.com/article/167087/roe-cvs-methotrexate-abortion-pills<p>So I'm asking this: what is the feasibility of automating a pharmacy, to make faster, cheaper, and less biased service for what your doctor orders? Have any YC companies approached this?<p>(Please note: this is a feasibility of automating pharmacies. I do not wish this to be yet another tired pro/anti abortion thread. We have enough of those online. And those never provide answers - only more angry people.)",
