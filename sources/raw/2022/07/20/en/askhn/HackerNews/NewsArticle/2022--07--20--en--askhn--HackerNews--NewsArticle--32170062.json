  "description": "I have been living and working at a FAANG in UK for past 2+ years now. I came on the now Global Talent visa, so in next 2 years I can become a UK citizen.<p>I am also closing in on my retirement/FU corpus, but I don't intend to stop working.<p>I am pondering if it's worth becoming a UK Citizen after Brexit if I want to do software consulting. \nWill the UK passport/citizenship help? My primary market targets will be UK, US and Europe, so Visa Waiver Program and short term EU visits should allow me to do business visits for contract negotiation etc.<p>I would prefer to work in UK for 6 months - 8 months of the year and be outside of UK in the winter :-).<p>UK citizens (naturalised or otherwise), any inputs? Is this a good or a flawed idea? I hold an Indian passport.<p>I don't want to worry about maintaining the ILR status, and anyways after ILR, it's just 1 year to get the British passport.<p>edit: notes on ILR",
