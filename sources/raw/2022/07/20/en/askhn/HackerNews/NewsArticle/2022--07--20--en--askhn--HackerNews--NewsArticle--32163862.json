  "description": "Google is currently contacting developers to remove unnecessary permissions from your app manifest or declare why it is needed.<p>Specifically, it's about &quot;powerful&quot; permissions like QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES or REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES.<p>The request in itself is understandable and reasonable.<p>However, the automated detection of these permissions doesn't seem to work that well (for me), leading to false positives in my case.<p>Both permissions were detected in one of my apps, although one was never used and the other was removed in time. Still, I got a warning by email after the permission was already removed.<p>Anybody has similar experiences here?",
