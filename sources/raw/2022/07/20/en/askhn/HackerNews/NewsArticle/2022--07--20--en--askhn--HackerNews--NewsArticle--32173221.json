  "description": "Sorry, the usual question... :P<p>This morning I read the post &quot;The Rust Performance Book (2020)&quot; and when I wanted to upvote it 10 hours later I had to go to page #4 (ranked currently #108 with 184 votes &quot;20 hours ago&quot;) =&gt; finding it on page #4 was weird for me (I would have never found that precious post if I would have checked HN only this evening).<p>The usual reply to my kind of question is &quot;click on 'past' to see a kind-of-better ranking&quot; but after having done that exactly &gt;now&lt; I see for example:<p>- at position #41 &quot;Logo and Learning (2015)&quot; (63 points, 3 days ago, 26 comments) and...<p>- at position #42 &quot;Americaâ€™s favorite family outings are increasingly out of reach&quot; ( 270 points, 1 day ago, 569 comments) - btw. I read this and for me it wasn't great but still interesting, so in the end I liked it, at least 10000 times more than &quot;logo and learning&quot; (which I glanced over).<p>I don't like the current ranking :(",
