  "description": "I created this chrome extension for myself where I track my own behavior locally and recommend myself content from platforms I want content from (youtube/twitter/quora/etc) in a feed. I made it public just in case anyone else was interested.<p>I would rather have control over my own algorithm and own the data. Also, it gives me flexibility. Turns out I do like these feeds just not when I don't own it haha. Let me know what you think of my implementation?",
