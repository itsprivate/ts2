  "description": "So there are a lot of posts here about personal knowledge databases &amp; note taking apps ... and methodologies.  I wanted a way to keep track of info &amp; just as importantly be able to easily see &amp; edit that data from anywhere.<p>I wanted it to be robust, free, web-based, able to host code examples as actual files (e.g. style.css or script.js), and host images.<p>Turns out this is all available with Github &amp; Gitlab.<p>Step 1: Create a Private Repo\nStep 2: Hit the . key or use the editor URL pattern: https://github.dev/{{username}}/{{repo-name}}\nStep 3: Start using ... you can add sub-directories with Markdown for notes ... you can add all the file types above.<p>For Gitlab just click &quot;Web IDE&quot; from your project's homepage.<p>(I made this URL: https://github.dev/{{username}}/{{repo-name}} my homepage, making it super easy to access.)<p>This is absolutely nothing new; but the epiphany I had a week or so ago about using a repo in this way seems to have really stuck (yes, a week is a short period of time but often a note app or approach sticks for a day or 2 for me).<p>I'm really curious if others do something like this &amp; what other sorts of practices they might employ while doing this.",
