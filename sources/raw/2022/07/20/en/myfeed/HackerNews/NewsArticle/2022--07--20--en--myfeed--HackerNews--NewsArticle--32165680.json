  "description": "I was finally able to finish this open-source project that I built to about 90% completion nearly 2 years ago when my daughter was born, during my 1-month parental leave, and then sadly left untouched until a few weeks ago. Hope you enjoy trying out the app and looking at the source code! :)<p>GitHub link here: <a href=\"https://github.com/jaredreich/calcutext\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/jaredreich/calcutext</a>",
