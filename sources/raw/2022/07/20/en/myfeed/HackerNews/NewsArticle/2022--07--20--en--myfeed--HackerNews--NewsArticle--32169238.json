  "description": "Dataherald is a no-code data platform that allows you to create and deploy powerful data content (charts, maps, graphs) in less than 60 seconds. We’ve automated ETL for hundreds of public and proprietary data sources, surfacing ready-to-use live-updating visualizations in as little as 3 clicks. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) inflation and employment data, FRED economic and automotive data, and hundreds of other fascinating data feeds are already piped in and at your fingertips – the only thing left is for you to create your own custom visualizations and generate insights from them. Dataherald helps you tell stories with data faster.<p>Take it for a spin and tell me what you think. We’re specifically interested in your feedback for the software interface and what data sources you would want (and for what purpose).",
