  "description": "Hey HN -<p>I've been having a hard time getting back into gaming when I'm in-and-out of it so often with particular games, so I built a very simple tool in my spare time to help folks find people to game with.<p>I tried to minimize friction: no user account needed &amp; you specify the game. You can search for specific games too or usernames even.<p>It's still in alpha stage, meaning it's super barebones and cool features that integrate with your current apps aren't there yet. We'll get there though.<p>Let me know if you have questions or recs!",
