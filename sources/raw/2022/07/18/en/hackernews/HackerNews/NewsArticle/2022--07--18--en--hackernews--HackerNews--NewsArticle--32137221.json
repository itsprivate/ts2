  "description": "Journaling is a great practice to learn more about yourself - if done daily.<p>I tried it multiple times and couldn't stick to it.<p>This project is how I finally fixed it for myself.<p>It works by eliminating my excuses.<p>There is only one question a day that I'll answer - no time spent on &quot;finding the perfect topic&quot;.<p>I only need to go to the page - not find my notebook or create a new note/paragraph in another app.<p>I only left myself a relatively small input area, less than a page in a small notebook - that way the commitment doesn't feel too big.<p>I really enjoy the process and it has become something that I do early in the morning - a little bit of time for myself.<p>It's now public because I am sure it could work for you too.<p>Bonus: The data is all local, the input will be saved in the browser (IndexedDB) while I type, no login necessary - the full journal is accessible as a CSV (bottom right).<p><a href=\"https://dailyprompt.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://dailyprompt.org</a>",
