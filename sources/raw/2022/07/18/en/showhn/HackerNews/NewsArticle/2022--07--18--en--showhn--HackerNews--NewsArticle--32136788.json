  "description": "Hi, HN.<p>I was struggling to get a color palette right for a small game I was making in Unity and decided I'd throw together something that gave me a few dials to play with. Naturally, when the proof of concept worked I began expanding it and then some every time I wanted more independent control.<p>It was initially born of frustration of not being able to do certain basic things in Photoshop, like invert HSV values independently. And if they were possible they were usually cumbersome.<p>Anyway, It's done it's job for me for now. So given that color related content seems to be popular here - and I've never contributed a piece of software to the world - I thought I'd upload it to the web &quot;as is&quot; for free and perhaps someone else might find it useful. Any feedback is appreciated and if there is enough demand I might continue working on.<p>Thanks for your time.",
