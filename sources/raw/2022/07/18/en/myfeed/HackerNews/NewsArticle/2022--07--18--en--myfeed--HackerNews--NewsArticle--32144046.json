  "description": "Hey HN! I built Hacker News Mods as a place to collect any tools or sites related to HN.<p>I know the community has build some incredible things around HN, but they're difficult to track. We also started building one mod/tool for HN per week, and thought it’d be a good idea to showcase all of the tools we’ve created, as well as tools that others have created. The site is pretty scrappy, so any feedback is appreciated!<p>Also, please submit any projects that we don’t already have listed!<p>Thanks, Jarren",
