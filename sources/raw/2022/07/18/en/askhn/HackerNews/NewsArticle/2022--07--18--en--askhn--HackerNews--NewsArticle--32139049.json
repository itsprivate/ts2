Meaning all emails go to blocked/triage/queue unless I specifically approve them for my inbox, or similar. I want my life uncluttered, I want to be stingy with where I place my attention.<p>I remember vaguely hearing about this kind of email inbox over the years, but I wasn't able to find any existing providers when I went to search for one this morning. Is anyone using a system like this, any suggestions?",
