  "description": "sometimes I take some short naps, 10 to 15 min afternoon. It always seems to give me a boost for the left hours. Also I usually do it when I have a problem that I don't know how I'm going to solve, but after the nap I feel like my brain is completely fresh and prepared to solve it. It's like a hidden superpower. I don't understand why people don't talk openly about more that and pretend they are always productive.",
