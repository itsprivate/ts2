  "description": "We recently released an online course. [1] It's $29, but we've had users saying, &quot;I'm in ${country poorer than USA}, and I can't afford the $29. Do you offer regional pricing?&quot;<p>I would like to support this. The dollar-value to a customer in India is probably lower than in the USA.<p>Most big platforms (Udemy, App Store, Play Store) seem to solve this with a price tier matrix. They maintain a big table of prices per (tier, currency). The tier comes from the product, and the currency comes from ... the user's IP address? (See example matrix [2])<p>To build this from scratch, I would have to:<p>* Define a list of tiers, each with a hard-coded USD price.<p>* Maintain a list of Purchasing Power Parity multipliers for each currency. For example, regularly scrape OECD data.<p>* To get a tier's price in currency X, multiply by the current PPP.<p>* Somehow clamp the prices to &quot;appealing&quot; values, so we get e.g. £25 instead of £24.19.<p>* Ensure we never make a loss after subtracting Stripe fees!<p>* Detect a user's location. Presumably using IP. Map location to a country, and country to a currency.<p>* Probably many more things I haven't thought of.<p>This feels like a generic problem that I shouldn't be re-solving myself. So, questions:<p>* What libraries/services can I use instead?<p>* How do you do implement localized pricing?<p>* Are there complexities that explain why there's not an out-of-the-box solution?<p>[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32118530\n[2]: https://s3.amazonaws.com/udemy-images/support/Udemy+Price+Tier+Matrix+-+EN+09-17+Matrix.pdf",
