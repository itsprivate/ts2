  "description": "My schedule currently only allows me time to workout after 5 PM due to life commitments and work.<p>I choose to go to workout classes because I make friends, and it pushes me much harder than I would push myself, and I see benefit in those things.<p>That said, last night like most nights I do this I couldnt fall asleep until the sun came up, despite going to bed at 11 PM.<p>I'm kind of running out of ideas so I figure I'll ask here, if only because we all tend to be weird in the same ways on this forum.<p>I have tried everything:<p>* Chamomile tea<p>* No screens in the bedroom<p>* Snack before bed (this helps probably the most if not inconsistently)<p>* Meditation before bed<p>* Stretching<p>* Melatonin 30 minutes before desired bed time (this one also helps maybe 40% of the time)<p>* THC (get <i>very</i> stuck in my head, does not work at all)<p>* No/dim lights in house to trigger sleep hormone production<p>* Progressive relaxation<p>* Warm shower before bed (wakes me up)<p>* Cold shower before bed (WAKES me up inside)<p>* No caffeine after noon<p>* No caffeine at all (Makes me a terrible person to others)<p>I'm out of ideas. I'm literally giving myself insomnia with these workouts. Its almost like I cant gear down, and want to keep being productive and am running on some kind of adrenaline / cortisol diesel mix that I cant get out of my system.<p>Has anyone found anything that works for them?",
