  "description": "Given a two-car garage, what can a small team (2-3 people) manufacture that can be sold for some amount of profit? Imagine access to capital of 20-50k USD at maximum.<p>Interesting would be items whose manufacture could be automatized to some extent, but this is not necessary.<p>I am not particularly interested in the legality of this at the moment. But safety considerations could be important.",
