  "description": "It seems like every service that I sign up for wants an email address to even look at information on their websites. Without much effort, I end up with a bazillion emails from all of these services. It feels like I want to set up aliases to at least group messages by the type of service but that even gets unwieldy at some point. How do y'all manage this? Is this a problem for you?<p>Thank you for your time.",
