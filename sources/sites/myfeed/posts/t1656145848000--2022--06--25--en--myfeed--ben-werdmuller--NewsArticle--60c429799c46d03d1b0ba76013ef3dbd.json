Notably, states like Texas make it illegal to <em>help</em> someone get an abortion, and <a href=\"https://19thnews.org/2021/08/texas-abortion-law-six-weeks-ban-would-do-more/\">allow <em>anyone</em> to sue someone for doing so</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/us-abortions-travel-wave-of-restrictions\">Abortion travel bans</a> are also looming: untested laws that would prevent someone from traveling to another state to get an abortion.</p><p>It’s remarkable that these sorts of restrictions should be placed on a woman’s right to choose what she does with her body in a democracy. It’s more remarkable still to see vigilante laws go into effect, and to see states weigh up legislation that denies people the right to choose whether to travel to a different state where abortion is legal. (<a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/oregon-ends-residency-rule-medically-assisted-suicide-83729883\">These restrictions don’t exist for assisted suicide, for example, after a Constitutional challenge.</a>)</p><p>For most people on the internet, their information journey begins with a service like Google or Facebook. On these services, <a href=\"https://www.steventituslaw.com/blog/can-google-search-history-be-used-as-evidence/\">your search history and other activity can be subpoenaed</a>, meaning that if you go to court, perhaps because someone sued you for trying to get an abortion, it can be used against you. <a href=\"https://revealnews.org/article/facebook-data-abortion-crisis-pregnancy-center/\">Pro-life organizations are already using Facebook to learn more about potential abortion payments.</a> Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7vzjb/location-data-abortion-clinics-safegraph-planned-parenthood\">a data broker was found to be selling data about people who visited Planned Parenthood.</a></p><p>So what happens if you do need an abortion? What kind of security stance should people take?</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/05/digital-security-and-privacy-tips-those-involved-abortion-access\">The Electronic Frontier Foundation has a guide</a> that sensibly describes compartmentalization, community agreements, and safe browsing. This is really important, smart advice, but it doesn’t go far enough in a world where your cellphone’s location data may reveal that you went to a clinic.</p><p><a href=\"https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/09/30/theres-a-multibillion-dollar-market-for-your-phones-location-data\">A lot of location data is derived from the apps you use</a>, and it’s usually not obvious which apps send information where. A few years ago, it was discovered that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/03/aclu-seeks-release-records-data-us-collected-via-muslim-app-used-millions\">a Muslim prayer app shared information with the US military</a>. It’s not inconceivable that an app wouldn’t, or isn’t, sharing data with law enforcement: although the Supreme Court ruled that law enforcement <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/06/22/605007387/supreme-court-rules-police-need-warrant-to-get-location-information-from-cell-to\">needs a warrant to get wireless carrier location data</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/04/26/constitution-digital-privacy-loopholes-purchases/\">it <em>can</em> buy location data from brokers</a>.</p><p>Abortion isn’t the last stop for this kind of legislation or approach: gender affirming care and <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/class-action/more-than-abortion-rides-on-scotus-in-dobbs\">even marriage equality</a> may be on the docket. Even more broadly, we should all consider whether we want to live in a world where our every private action can be tracked and used against us. Miranda rights state that “anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law”; we’ve built a reality where anything we do can, too, whether or not we’ve been made aware.</p><p>The most effective protection would be a legislature that is in favor of an individuals’s right to choose and to privacy. <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/17/bill-location-data-ban-roe/\">A group of Senators is seeking a ban on the sale of health location data</a>, following <a href=\"https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Wyden-led%20letter%20to%20Google%20on%20geofence%20data%20and%20abortion-related%20surveillance%205.24.22.pdf\">a letter that was sent to Google CEO Sundar Pichai urging the same</a>. But failing legislative protection, pro-choice advocates need to begin building grassroots infosec skills and tools if they want to prevent this data from being used against abortion-seekers. Today, there is very little out there to help.</p><p>A few days ago, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benwerd/status/1537558227419660289\">I asked the question:</a> <em>Who is doing the best work on infosec for women who may be seeking an abortion?</em> As of now, there are no good answers.</p><p> </p><p><em>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@mannyb?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Manny Becerra</a> on </em><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/abortion?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\"><em>Unsplash</em></a></p></div>",
