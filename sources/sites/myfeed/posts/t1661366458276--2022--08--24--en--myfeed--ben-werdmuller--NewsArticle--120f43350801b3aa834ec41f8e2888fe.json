An adaptable folding stroller.

Theoretically, then, the stroller can last for years, as the baby grows bigger. Although I haven’t yet had the opportunity to try it with a real life baby (soon!), it seems stunningly well-designed in a way that a lot of technology hardware isn’t. Buttons do what you think they should do, and folding it up for storage is one very simple, quick motion.</p><p><a href=\"https://uppababy.com/mesa/\">Uppababy Mesa</a>. A car seat that was shockingly easy to install in my car. Even better, it clicks out of its base really simply, and can actually click into the Uppababy Cruz stroller. It all just works seamlessly, like an Apple ecosystem for babies. I have memories of my parents struggling with belts and braces for car seats, and that doesn’t seem to be a thing anymore. Good.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.happiestbaby.com/\">Happiest Baby SNOO</a>. A smart bassinet. It looks and sounds like something out of a dystopian science fiction novel: it automatically soothes the baby and helps them sleep, like something aliens might do if they were raising humans on a farm. I still don’t know how I feel about it, honestly, but I’ll form a better opinion later on. If it turns out everyone hates the smart features, it also just looks like a well-made baby bed.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.hatch.co/rest\">Hatch Rest</a>. A combination night light and natural-sound white noise machine. I don’t know about baby, but it helps <em>me</em> sleep.</p><p>We have some baby wraps and carriers, but I feel like a three year old learning to put on a sweater.
