I am still working out kinks in the backend, particularly cold-start issues because the Lambda function has to load the entire Torch library (~2GB). This occasionally causes the AWS API Gateway to reach max timeout before the Lambda function finishes. Any tips on addressing this would be much appreciated. My first thought is maybe to pare down the Torch library used in the Lambda function because I am only using a small subset of the full library.<p>The optimizer function itself is designed to overcome several classic shortcomings in Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory</a>). Unlike textbook implementations of MPT, this optimizer can utilize non-normal returns distributions, risk metrics besides variance, and can allow the user to specify tail behavior, such as asset correlations behaving normally most of the time but converging to 1.0 in severe downturns. Most of these &quot;fixes&quot; happen during the generation of custom &quot;flavors&quot;, or asset selection universes. I have 3 flavors pre-built and there is some information on how they are constructed in the flavor selection page.<p>Any feedback greatly appreciated!<p>Justin Luther justinluther@lutherwealth.com <a href=\"https://www.lutherwealth.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.lutherwealth.com</a>",
