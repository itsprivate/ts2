  "description": "Hi HN,<p>I released Trane over the weekend: <a href=\"https://github.com/trane-project/trane\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/trane-project/trane</a>. Trane is an automated\nsystem for learning complex skills. Think of it like defining a skills tree (technically a graph) of\nall the smaller skills you need to master a complex skill and having an automated system to\nautomatically traverse the graph as you master them.<p>The seed for Trane was planted after my frustration trying to learn music, and jazz in particular.\nThere are simply too many things you need to master first (e.g. knowing the names of a note, knowing\nwhere the notes are in your instrument, timing, etc) and it becomes difficult to track what it is\nthat you should focus on, and there is a process of constant atrophy, even if you practice\nconsistently.<p>Trane is an early state, but is already usable. I have released a command line interface at\n<a href=\"https://github.com/trane-project/trane-cli\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/trane-project/trane-cli</a> and some music courses at\n<a href=\"https://github.com/trane-project/trane-music\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/trane-project/trane-music</a>.<p>I would like to get some ideas in regard to what other skills could be a good fit for Trane. I am\nthinking chess, programming, or languages could be a fit. I am wondering if Trane could be applied\nto something like learning pure mathematics. I would love to hear any suggestions. Perhaps there's\nsome of you who have found a similar issue while practicing your own hobbies.",
