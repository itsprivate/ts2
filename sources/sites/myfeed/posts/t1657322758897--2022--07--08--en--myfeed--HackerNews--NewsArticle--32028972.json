Just specify an amount and currency to pay out in, and share the link that we generate.<p>We built Triple Payments to solve one of the most annoying problems we faced as web3 developers – requesting crypto without going back-and-forth on tokens and wallet addresses. When sending large sums of USDC or ETH, we were never 100% sure that our money was going to the right wallets.<p>Under the hood, we let payers send ETH or stablecoins like USDC directly by calling standard transfer methods that work with their web3 wallets. If payers don’t have any of the requested currency, we give them the option to pay with a different token, using the 0x [1] platform and our custom contract to swap tokens behind the scenes.<p>We’d love it if you could try creating a payment request, and look forward to hearing your feedback and suggestions!<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://www.0x.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.0x.org/</a>",
