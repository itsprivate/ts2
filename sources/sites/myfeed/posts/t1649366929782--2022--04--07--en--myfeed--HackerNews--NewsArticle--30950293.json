  "description": "This is a rant of sorts, but I'm seeing this more and more, not just on HN, but in lots of places.<p>Folks will be discussing some topic (the genre doesn't seem to matter) and a commenter will respond with something like, &quot;yeah, this is just like...&quot; or something similar, and include a youtube (or other video) link without any context or reason why it's relevant or any inkling as to the content of such a video.<p>What then?  Now I either have to go off whatever site I'm <i>reading</i> and watch some video that may or may not have anything to do with the subject at hand.<p>Even worse, like most people I can read a lot faster than some talking head in a video can get to the point, thus wasting my time.<p>Or I can just move on to the next comment and ignore the video link.  Which might be rather unfortunate, as there may actually be something useful/interesting/informative going on.<p>For my own part, I may sometimes link to videos, but only in the context of a comment where I'm actually making the point <i>in the comment itself</i> and linking to the video to either support my point, provide additional context and/or act as a citation of something I've quoted/referenced in my comment.<p>Seeing stuff like &quot;This is why $issue is how it is&quot; or &quot;$RandomPerson will [blow your mind|explain everything|is so profound]&quot; with no context or other information really doesn't add anything valuable to the discussion at hand.<p>For pity's sake, if you're on a <i>discussion</i> site, then discuss stuff!  If a video presents an interesting viewpoint or useful information, include it in your comment with a note that the linked video provides more informtion/context/argument, etc.<p>But a comment that contains nothing but &quot;this is amazing&quot; or &quot;$person nailed it here&quot; is, quite literally, clickbait.  And not even <i>good</i> clickbait.<p>I get that some folks aren't native English speakers and may feel that the video will provide a much better explanation of their thoughts than the poster thinks they can exposit.  But please, at least provide some kind of context!<p>I come to discussion sites to <i>discuss</i>, not watch videos.  If I wanted to watch videos, I'd do that instead.<p>/rant<p>I generally just ignore such links/comments, because I'm here (and elsewhere) to discuss stuff.<p>Am I being overly judgemental here, or do others also feel that such &quot;comments&quot; reduce the value of a discussion if it's necessary to go off-site to view (sometimes hours-long) videos just to figure out what the commenter is banging on about?<p>Your thoughts?",
