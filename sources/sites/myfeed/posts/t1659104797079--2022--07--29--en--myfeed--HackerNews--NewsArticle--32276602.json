  "description": "Hey HN, I use twitter a lot and often bookmark interesting tweets to come back to later, but find that I rarely actually come back to them (twitter's native bookmarks interface is kind of high friction).

It uses SQLIte in the browser via WASM to store your liked and bookmarked tweets locally, and then lets you do instant full text search over all of them (powered by SQLite's FTS extension). There's also a SQL console built in, so if you know SQL you can slice and dice your bookmarks and likes to your heart's content. You can also export all your liked or bookmarked tweets as JSON to use them outside of BirdBear.<p>Right now the focus is on bookmarks and likes, but the plan is to build this into a more general twitter data tool to let you locally download tweets from all the accounts you follow, keep them up to date, and to add organization features like folders and tagging. A sort of personal tweeterbase if you will.<p>How do you keep track of the tweets you like?
