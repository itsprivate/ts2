  "description": "It's like a loan because the founders don't have the money or the revenue to afford what they are trying to do. Eventually it has to be paid.<p>Somehow when folks take a large loan and buy a house which they can't really afford, usually they don't shout about it on social media forums.<p>But somehow when it comes to start-ups it's almost worn as a badge of merit?<p>Why is that the case and why don't more companies try to raise money later in the cycle and try and make do with their product revenue?",
