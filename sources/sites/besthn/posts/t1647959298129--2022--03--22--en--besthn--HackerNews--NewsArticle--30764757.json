  "description": "This morning, I received a marketing email from Cloudflare (through one of our mailing groups), being militant about these kinds of emails, I immediately go to unsubscribe.<p>Dark pattern one: You must login to manage your marketing preferences. There's no security related emails here, so this is completely unnecessary.<p>Dark pattern two: &quot;...confirm your email address to save your communication preferences.&quot;. I've no idea how we have a several-year old account without a confirmed email, but it should not have to confirm an email to remove old marketing preferences - or if cloudflare is so careful about this, why did it end up opted-in ion the first place?<p>Dark pattern two-point-five is that the email somehow became unverified - something it seems is only necessary to adjust marketing emails.<p>Okay, so I hit the &quot;Resend verification email&quot; link and check my inbox, nothing just yet. I wait a little longer. It's odd that I immediately got a security email about the login from a new IP, but I've not received this verification email yet.<p>10 minutes later, and I've still not got anything. I know these things <i>can</i> take longer, but I don't have the patience, especially since Cloudflare are clearly trying to make this hard.<p>Going to the preferences page, I hit that verify link again - still nothing. Okay, F12, I switch to the network inspector and click the link <i>again</i>.<p>To my surprise: Absolutely nothing. There's no network requests being initiated by this link. Maybe it's websockets, or maybe there's a script that failed to load? The UI does respond when I hit the link, but nothing else. I opened up the element inspector to find a click handler:<p><pre><code>  function () {\n      return a.setState({\n          toast: 'verificationResent'\n      })\n  }\n\n</code></pre>\nThat is certainly less than I was expecting. If that's just a react setState... this link is literally doing nothing other changing the UI when I press it. Perhaps some silly frontend developer reads that `toast` state elsewhere to trigger the real behaviour? Nope the only other reference to verificationResent is a ternary statement in the render function.<p>Dark pattern three: Just break unsubscribe. The cynic in me says this was intentional. Hanlon's razor tells me perhaps it is just a mistake, in which case dark pattern three is the overengineering of the unsubscribe function so you can get as much dropoff as possible and it's most convenient if it just breaks.<p>So wtf Cloudflare?<p>Oh, and to supplement dark pattern two: The verification check is only on the frontend. In the end, I was able to use the debugger to skip the verified check and edit &amp; submit my email preferences anyway.",
