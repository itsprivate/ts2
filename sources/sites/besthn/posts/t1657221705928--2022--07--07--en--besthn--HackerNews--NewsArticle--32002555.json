A friend was involved in a custody battle and was afraid his ex was going to leak all of his discovery documents on the internet and he asked if there was something I could do to make it harder for bots/crawlers to find sensitive information. Originally I was going to turn all of his docs to image based PDFs, but those get large fast and are easy to OCR.<p>So I found a post musing about altering fonts/glyphs so that it <i>looks</i> like english, but the actual character being seen by the pdf reader is a non-english character. As such, when you try to OCR these files, it doesn't see any images and can't convert it.<p>I figured it had some potential uses and maybe you fine folks can identify other use cases.
