  "description": "Hey HN,<p>Blog discovery is a problem [0] due to the decentralized nature of online writing. Everyone writes on their own site or platform, and there’s no central place that brings everything together. Google results prioritize large media publications over blogs, so we need something else.<p>Blog Surf is an attempt to organize all of the great online writing done by individuals. I launched this project last year as a directory of personal blogs [1], but have now rebuilt it from scratch into a full-text search engine for blog posts.<p>You can search for blog posts, and filter by publish date and reading time. Blogs are manually reviewed before being added.<p>Posts are sorted by MarketRank [2], which is a measure of popularity across various online communities. Most projects that have attempted to organize blogs lack any way to measure the quality of a post, reducing their utility. With MarketRank, you can expect the top results for any query to be something you’d want to read.<p>The mental model for searching Blog Surf is “I want to see the best essays on X”<p>There’s also a directory so you can browse blogs by category, if you want a throwback to the Yahoo days.<p>If you’re a blogger yourself, you can check out the rankings page to see how your blog compares to others.<p>If you want to play around with things, we have a search API, and the full post dataset is also available for download.<p>[0] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28591880\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28591880</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26506126\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26506126</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://dkb.io/post/market-rank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://dkb.io/post/market-rank</a>",
