  "description": "Hi HN – we first launched Supernotes[1] to HN in April 2020, and since then Tobias and I (it's just the two of us) have put in the work to make what we hope is an amazing note-taking app. Although the note-taking / personal knowledge management landscape is <i>incredibly</i> competitive at the moment (with lots of great apps adding great new features every day), we think that with the newly released Supernotes 2 we're keeping pace and delivering a unique and satisfying knowledge management experience.<p>Here's the combination of features that make us stand out:<p>- a powerful markdown-based notecard system that is simple/beautiful but also super flexible<p>- a WYSIWYM[2] editor that keeps markdown marks for explicitness while still giving you a preview of what the content looks like when rendered<p>- eschewing a folder system in favor of multi-parent nested hierarchies<p>- unique collaboration system that is optimized for granular sharing between individuals rather than &quot;all-in&quot; sharing amongst teams or specific groups<p>- notes that can be linked both with inline bidirectional links or the aforementioned hierarchies, allowing you to build (and <i>experience</i> with our 2D and 3D graph views) a robust graph of your knowledge<p>There are of course tons of other cool features that are included as well, but those are the highlights. If any of that sounds interesting to you, you can sign up here[3] – we would love to hear any feedback you might have!<p>[1] <a href=\"https://supernotes.app/?ref=hn\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://supernotes.app/?ref=hn</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https://my.supernotes.app/entry?signup=1&amp;ref=hn\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://my.supernotes.app/entry?signup=1&amp;ref=hn</a>",
