  "description": "Hi HN,<p>I’m Stefan, a 23 year old student working on Edify. Edify is a network of knowledge feeds connecting knowledge with problems. We think the world is a set of problems and solutions, and solutions to problems can only be found through knowledge. A sense of purpose, the highest form of happiness, comes from using your knowledge to solve problems. This process is easier with Edify because we help find problems you can solve to earn money when you share knowledge. You can share your knowledge by sharing projects with communities of people with similar interests through clubs.<p>I feel like the main goal people have is to learn from the world around them and creatively use what they’ve learned to fulfill a purpose. Our purpose at Edify is to help people find their purpose by organizing their knowledge.
