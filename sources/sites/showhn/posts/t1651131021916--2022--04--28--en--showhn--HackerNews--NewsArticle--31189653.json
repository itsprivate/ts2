  "description": "Hey HackerNews!  I'm really excited to introduce... Elon's Shenanigans, the first-ever no-code metaverse NFT web3 app. Now available on your all devices here: https://install.page/elonmusk<p><i>What does it do?</i><p>Elon's Shenanigans is a real functional app you can install on your Homescreen/Desktop/Dock to get quick access to Elon Musk's Twitter feed. You can install it on iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Chrome OS from the universal installation link above.<p><i>The problem we're solving</i><p>None, really. But Elon Musk's Tweet feed is so entertaining in and of itself that we reckoned it deserved its own app.<p><i>How much does it cost?</i>\nIt's completely FREE, forever and ever, until the end of time! We want to focus on user growth right now and think about monetization later.<p>Our future plans include collecting as much data on you as possible and a $499/month subscription for dark mode.<p><i>What's the market for this?</i><p>Elon Musk has 80 million followers. We calculated we can acquire 10% of them. If half of those users need dark mode, that's $328 billion ARR. Humongous TAM, SAM, SOM, TOM, and MOM.<p><i>Who are our competitors?</i><p>We don't have any. But it wouldn't really matter anyway since we have 5 pending patents.<p><i>What's our ask?</i><p>We're looking to raise a $50 million Pre-Seed. If interested, fill out the Google Form on our website and I'll get back to you with my Calendly link whenever I have time (you'll have to sign an NDA before the call).<p><i>Who is on the team?</i><p>I'm a Former Facebook CEO, Forbes 70 Under 70 Awardee, Two-Time Nobel Prize Runner-Up, Olympic Squash Bronze Medalist. Also an Internet Evangelist and Uppercase-Letter Enthusiast.<p>My 6-year-old daughter is in charge of design.
