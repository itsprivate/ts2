  "description": "Hi Hacker News Community, I want to showcase (another) game-based learning for mathematics that I built. Descartes' Dungeon introduces ideas in coordinate geometry (points, 2D space, lines). NO SIGNUP NEEDED to try out the game. Desktop/tablets work well. If you are facing an issue on mobile, please use the alternate URL <a href=\"https://harshadss.itch.io/descartes-dungeon\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://harshadss.itch.io/descartes-dungeon</a> in landscape mode\nThere are many games for primary grades but nothing for higher maths. This is my attempt at changing it with games that are hopefully fun and curricular, for higher grades. The target is lifelong learners and teenagers. If you like these games but want to learn more about maths, there are short courses on the website. These courses use interactive dialogue-based activities, games, short videos and quizzes on the website (login is required).<p>This idea is early stage. I'm still figuring it out, but I envision something like brilliant.org but a lot more game based and interactive. I am working on two more courses: logarithms (perhaps a 3D game) and calculus. I'm open to hearing all kinds of feedback about this effort. Happy to answer more questions about the project as well. Email is 'harshad AT pledu.co'",
