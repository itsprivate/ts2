  "description": "Hello HN,<p>I like Ansible as a tool for automation to perform tasks on multiple remote hosts. But like many of you, I'm sick of the custom YAML DSL that many of this kind of tools provide.<p>How many times have we said &quot;just give me a true scripting language!&quot; ?<p>That's why I started this project `tricorder` (as in Star Trek's tricorder, a simple device to do pretty much anything required by the plot).<p>For now, it's only a tool to execute a command on multiple hosts (like ansible, but without the YAML) and returning the outputs as JSON so you can query it with other tools like `jq` in your bash scripts. But with time, I intend to add other tools to provide the following features:<p><pre><code>  - mimic the &quot;gather facts&quot; feature from ansible\n  - upload/download files to/from remote hosts\n  - Rust API to include in your projects\n  - bindings to other languages like Python/TypeScript/Go\n</code></pre>\nI'd be happy to have some feedback on the source code (as Rust is not my main language) or on what features you'd like to see implemented.<p>Thank you :)<p>Link to the Github repository: https://github.com/linkdd/tricorder",
