  "description": "I've been working on a library for developing websites visually. There are many tools for building websites, but none that fit my workflow as a front-end developer, so I made my own! It is an open source library called ProductDiv and it lets you:<p>- Drag and drop any HTML template into your site.<p>- Change elements with utility classes you can customize<p>- Export clean HTML elements and copy into your source code.<p>- Use in any framework!<p>ProductDiv is developer-first, meaning the configuration for the editor lives in your source code. You can evolve the configuration as your project grows (as it inevitably will!). This lets you standardize design patterns and makes it easy to distribute high quality components to your team.<p>I published a demo at <a href=\"https://awestbro.github.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://awestbro.github.io/</a> that includes Bootstrap 5 utility classes and some basic templates to experiment with.<p>I would love your feedback on UX and to answer the big question: Would you use this in your project? Why or why not?",
