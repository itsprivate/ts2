  "description": "Hi, HN<p>I showed my project Trane (<a href=\"https://github.com/trane-project/trane\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/trane-project/trane</a>) a few weeks ago.<p>I have kept working on it, but I would like more feedback from users, which is difficult\nat the moment because there's only a command-line interface at the moment and not a lot of material for it yet.<p>So I figured I would create some more technical courses to hopefully get more technical users to try it out. I just created a set of courses to practice Leetcode exercises, using the set from neetcode.io. The result is trane-leetcode (<a href=\"https://github.com/trane-project/trane-leetcode\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/trane-project/trane-leetcode</a>).<p>Unlike an exercise asking you to perform a piece of music or to solve a chess puzzle, the problems in these courses are more open-ended. What solving the problem means is up to you. You could force yourself to code the solution from scratch every time you are shown a problem, but this could get old soon. You could also code it the first time(s), and just draft a solution in pseudocode afterwords. Or you could simply review the solution and assign yourself a score based on how much of it you remembered.<p>Let me know if you tried it and have any feedback on either the courses or specially on Trane itself.<p>Other courses:<p>- trane-music: <a href=\"https://github.com/trane-project/trane-music\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/trane-project/trane-music</a><p>- trane-ruslings: <a href=\"https://github.com/trane-project/trane-rustlings\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/trane-project/trane-rustlings</a>",
