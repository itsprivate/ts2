I'm not proficient in front-end development at all, my past experience in this area being basically vanilla HTML/CSS, with a tiny bit of JS. This is in fact my first try at using any front-end framework. I sincerely welcome all feedback.<p>The idea came to me when I tried to convey the idea of an exercise in a music forum. No forum I've used have native support for any form of sheet music. It's either typing &quot;CDEFGAB&quot;, which isn't very readable and scales horribly for anything complex; or sharing an image, which is tedious because you have to open up an engraving software, export, and upload. And none of those approach has audio.
