It adapts to your preferred design tools, tech stack, and workflows with ease and lets you launch upto 4x faster, while letting designers design the way they want and giving high-quality responsive code that developers love.<p>With this launch, you can convert your Figma designs into React, React Native, Next.js, Gatsby, and HTML-CSS code. You get a live-responsive prototype that runs on code (we call these ‘real-fidelity prototypes’) and when good to go, you can either export the code to build on top of it or directly deploy to Netlify, Vercel, or Github.<p>Today, we have also launched on Product Hunt.
