  "description": "Hey HN!<p>I've built an iOS app called Maroofy (maroofy.com), which lets you find new favorite music by swiping through an infinite mix of 30s song clips.<p>It originally started out as an AI-based search engine where you could search for songs that sounded similar to any given song: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30051909\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30051909</a> -- (btw, I've integrated all of the feedback from that older post into this latest version! :))<p>But based on early user feedback, I realized that a &quot;discovery-based&quot; UI (using the same AI model) would offer a much better UX than the &quot;search-based&quot; UI that I had built -- which lead me to create this app.<p>I've been able to find a lot of new favorite songs from my own testing so far, so I thought it would be nice to share it here and let others try it out as well!<p>Early access: <a href=\"https://airtable.com/shr2t9o35UbHFq5nI\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://airtable.com/shr2t9o35UbHFq5nI</a><p>Would love to hear your thoughts &amp; feedback on the app, idea, your music discovery experience, etc.! :D<p>Note: In order to try Maroofy, you'll need an iPhone w/ TestFlight installed + some public playlist URLs containing songs that you love, so that I can teach the app's AI about your particular music tastes when I create your early-access account! :)",
