  "description": "Hey HackerNews!<p>One of the most common problems in IT projects is the problem of out-of-date documentation or lack of documentation. Architecture diagrams are an essential part of it.<p>C4 Model is trying to help with that by providing a tool that helps to standardize a way to create clear architecture diagrams on multiple levels.<p>But having a standard practice to follow is not enough to have this documentation up-to-date. Because of that, Krzysztof from my team created a script that can make these diagrams directly from the code.<p>Unfortunetly we can't share our company code. Fortunately, we have Wild Workouts DDD example that is a perfect use case to show the power of that tool: <a href=\"https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/wild-workouts-go-ddd-example\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/wild-workouts-go-ddd-exampl...</a>.<p>The linked article describes all the needed steps to create these diagrams. Feel free to play with it and try to add it to your project.<p>If you want to know more about Wild Workouts DDD example, they are already 14 articles that describe the project in detail: <a href=\"https://threedots.tech/series/modern-business-software-in-go/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://threedots.tech/series/modern-business-software-in-go...</a>.",
