  "description": "Hi,<p>this is for everybody who is interested in clean tech, especially real-time automation within new energy systems.<p>We've been working on FlexMeasures for a while ― an energy management system (EMS) with a focus on using demand flexibility to its maximum potential.<p>We're running it in several pilots ourselves, but our aim is to speed up the energy transition across the world. Let's not re-invent the wheel (i.e. a software stack around time series and optimization) too many times. Wherever you are in the world, and whatever setting you might be looking at (energy-modern housing in the U.S., smart e-mobility in Africa, self-balancing microgrids in Indonesia, etc.), maybe some of you will like our approach.<p>We've decided that making it easy and clear for developers to build such energy solutions can bring the largest gains. The first step towards that goal was a permissive license (Apache 2.0). The latest step we took was a Docker image (we got a Docker-based tutorial here: <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tut/toy-example-from-scratch.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tut/toy-exampl...</a>).<p>You can see the code at <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures</a><p>Since recently, FlexMeasures is a project within the Linux Energy Foundation (<a href=\"https://www.lfenergy.org/projects/flexmeasures/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.lfenergy.org/projects/flexmeasures/</a>), which helps to establish a proper governance and quality standard.<p>Actually, upcoming Thursday is our next Technical Steering Committee meeting, and interested people are warmly invited:<p>Thursday, June 16 at 8:00 am US Pacific Time / 11:00 am US Eastern\ntime / 5:00 pm Central European Time<p><a href=\"https://meet.google.com/cyu-inss-oik\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://meet.google.com/cyu-inss-oik</a><p>We'd love to hear from you!",
