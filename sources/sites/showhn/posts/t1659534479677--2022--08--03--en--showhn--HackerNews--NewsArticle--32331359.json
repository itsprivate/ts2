  "description": "We are Jason and Alex and are very excited to be launching Adadot <a href=\"https://adadot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://adadot.com/</a> in this community. We have spent 15+ years in remote tech teams in unicorns, start-ups and scaleups.<p>Developers are increasingly under pressure to be more productive and ship faster. However, its difficult to improve what you cannot see or measure.<p>My role (Alex) was in operations and I was collaborating with Sales, Finance and other teams. All these teams had systems like Salesforce and SAP that helped them quantify what “good looks like”.<p>Meanwhile engineering (Jason’s background), was flying blind and spending up to two hours a day patching data together for their sprint meetings.<p>Some of the challenges that we faced in trying to solve this for ourselves were that:<p>Most of the data a developer can use for insight is fragmented and spread across multiple tools like Gitlab / Github / Jira / Slack / Calendar\nMost of the insight is organised around tasks / projects. While this type of information is helpful to an extent, at the end of the day were people managing people\nTypical developer metrics were one-dimensional. Developers who were great collaborators always seemed to score lower on classic productivity metrics but they add true value<p>Our goal is to help developers improve the way they work, collaborate, and feel through data.<p>Software in this space has traditionally focused on monitoring developers and their performance for the benefit of their manager. We took a different approach.<p>Adadot is developer-centric meaning that we focus on empowering each developer to improve their own working patterns with data that only admins in their company would have been previously able to access. Team managers can see aggregated data only. Any individual developer can sign up and use Adadot without having to be part of a team licence.<p>More importantly, the work of a developer is not just code and its our core belief that the current definitions around productivity are limited. Burnout is a very real problem. Great collaborators and people who lift their teams up are underserved by code-focused engineering productivity tools.<p>Right as we started building Adadot Github's SPACE <a href=\"https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3454124\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3454124</a> productivity came about scientifically validating our thinking!<p>Finally, we figured that no developer on the planet wants to manually enter data. So we found a way to collect and process data automatically through integrations.<p>For now the output is dashboards and benchmarks centered around three core data themes:<p>Work: Classic data-driven engineering metrics, like deployment speed and failure rate. Identify blockers in real time<p>Collaboration: Understanding if the work is happening in silos, if the team are helping each other (eg. with code reviews, participating in Support channel) and if messages and meetings are becoming a distraction<p>Wellbeing: Helping you to uncover unhealthy working patterns and protect yourself and your team from burnout. Is there enough Focus time for deep code work and when? Surfacing upskilling and new languages that are being used<p>What this is not: A monitoring tool that will tell you (or your manager) who in your team has been lazy.<p>Results:\nWe are seeing teams improve velocity by up to 50% within the first 30 days. 70% also maintain the rate of improvement for at least 3 months meaning that they are able to increase their productivity sustainably.<p>Individual developers are using it to improve their collaboration visibility and gain promotions to managerial positions.<p>Check out:<p>Our demo: <a href=\"https://share.vidyard.com/watch/XEctQFzdQpMgpnjY4giFNV\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://share.vidyard.com/watch/XEctQFzdQpMgpnjY4giFNV</a><p>Public Roadmap: <a href=\"https://adadot.prodcamp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://adadot.prodcamp.com/</a><p>Knowledge base: <a href=\"https://adadothelp.document360.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://adadothelp.document360.io/</a><p>Our Ask:\nIf you are a developer - we would love for you to try Adadot and give us your feedback.
