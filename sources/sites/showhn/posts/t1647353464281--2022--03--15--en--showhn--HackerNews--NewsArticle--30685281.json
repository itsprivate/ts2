  "description": "TLDR: I'm building a cryptography puzzle game. Try it out at: <a href=\"https://clujhunt.com/ciphers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://clujhunt.com/ciphers</a><p>Hey, HN!<p>I'm Tudor and I'm working on a puzzle game where you solve increasingly difficult ciphers using a custom coded decryption tool that should make the process more enjoyable.\nAfter you solve each puzzle, you are rewarded with pieces of a story about a cryptography enthusiast, set in 1930s Germany.<p>The hardest part of this project was building the accompanying decryption tool. I wanted it to be mobile-friendly and it’s the part I iterated on the most, after receiving feedback from friends and early testers.<p>You can play the game here: <a href=\"https://clujhunt.com/ciphers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://clujhunt.com/ciphers</a><p>For those who don’t feel like playing the game, I made a 2-minute video demo of the decryption tool: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vENHCt25P4M\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vENHCt25P4M</a><p>Disclaimer: There is a $5 paywall after you finish the second puzzle. I don't expect to make money off it at this early stage. Instead, I use the paywall to measure what percentage of people are actually interested in this type of game.<p>Any feedback would be much appreciated and valuable, just leave a comment, I'll be happy to chat . If you prefer email, my address is: sendtudor@gmail.com<p>Thanks :)\nTudor",
