  "description": "Use Spotify? This tool will automate your music discovery for you. Join here (100% perpetually free with no strings attached): <a href=\"https://brew.fm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://brew.fm</a><p>Some time ago, I built and showed HN[1] brew.fm, a tool helping artists remix each other’s work. It had been quiet, and I remembered how fun it was to work with the Spotify API, so I repurposed the tool to solve one of my own problems: missing out on new music of my favorite artists.  I shared it on Reddit yesterday[2], and this seems to hit a spot for more people: so far 833 people connected their Spotify account.<p>How it works: The tool simply shows your top 50 artists on Spotify over short, medium and long term, and checks those artists for new music. If you select a playlist, every artist involved in the tracks will be checked for new music, after which new releases are shown sorted by most recent release date.<p>Here’s a video of me demoing the tool: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Nh2Ognb4PgU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/Nh2Ognb4PgU</a>.
