  "description": "Hello HN. I made this Windows desktop app that allows using voice activation with games or apps that only support push-to-talk.<p>The initial version was written years ago, without any UI or configuration options. It was just for my personal use. I had told a few friends about it, though, and then one of them asked if he could get a copy to use with Discord priority speaker, since for years, it has only worked with push-to-talk. So I spent some time making a more user-friendly version.<p>It's written almost exclusively in C and uses Nuklear [1] for the UI. It has an auto updater. The releases are hashed with BLAKE3 and signed with ECC.<p>I also recently made an open source USB device [2] that the app can use to send input from a &quot;real&quot; keyboard because, it turns out, there are some games (CSGO) that ignore simulated input for activating the microphone.<p>I'm having some trouble finding users though. I've tried posting on a few Discord servers and subreddits for games whose players I suspect would find the app useful but self-promotion and advertising are generally not allowed in these communities, so my posts get removed quite quickly. Any tips on how to best reach my audience?<p>[1] <a href=\"https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://github.com/veyh/AutoPTT-Sidekick\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/veyh/AutoPTT-Sidekick</a>",
