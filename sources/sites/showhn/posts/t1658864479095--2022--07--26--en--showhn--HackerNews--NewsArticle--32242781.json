  "description": "Hello HN, my name is Chris. My team and I are excited to announce the launch of our new open source UI component library called Skeleton.<p>We've been hard at work for several months and am thrilled to finally pull back the curtain. The goal is to put it out there, let folks go hands on, and gather any feedback we can. If there's bug, a component you would like to see added etc., then we want to know so we can continue to grow and make this better for everyone.<p>Being open source, we welcome any contributions from the community. If you're interested in joining, you can find us on Github:<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Brain-Bones/skeleton\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Brain-Bones/skeleton</a><p>And yes, we realize that the combination of Svelte and Tailwind may place us in a niche. Personally speaking, we've had a lot of success with these technologies in the real world. We love what Rich Harris and his team are bringing to the frontend space with Svelte and SvelteKit, and have found Tailwind to be a great boon when creating design systems for web-based apps We're really hoping Skeleton can bridge the gap and provide the best of both worlds, while saving you the time of recreating these components yourself.<p>That's really the biggest benefit of Skeleton - the tight integration between Svelte and Tailwind CSS. It utilizes Tailwind’s utility classes to customize and extend the look and feel of each component. Then pairs this with Svelte’s awesome component architecture. This allows you to create customized, responsive, and reactive interfaces with surprisingly minimal effort.<p>Of course, feel free to try it out for yourself. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm excited to see what everyone can produce with Skeleton!<p>Thanks!",
