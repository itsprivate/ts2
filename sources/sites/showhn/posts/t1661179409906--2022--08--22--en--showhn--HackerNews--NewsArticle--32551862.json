  "description": "Hello everyone!<p>As someone who's constantly on the look for new music to discover, I needed a better way to organize the albums I want to listen to, listened and liked. And also I would like to see the discoveries of other folks who I know I like.<p>So I started creating the tool I wish I had in the first place. In Digs, the basic idea is that:<p>- you can add music releases (albums, EPs, singles, mixes) in three lists: Want to Listen, Listened, Digged. You can also use tags and notes to better organize these lists.<p>- you get a public profile where your activity is visible (i.e. what you added to your lists). Example profile: <a href=\"https://digs.fm/alskn\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://digs.fm/alskn</a>.<p>- you can add other people as friends. Then you'll see their activity in your home feed.<p>- you can either like or add a comment to any activity  of your friends (or yours)<p>- you can explicitly recommend a release to one of your friends<p>This is very early yet and there are a lot of rough edges.<p>You can find a few screenshots of the basic functionality in the homepage, from where you can also create an account - <a href=\"https://digs.fm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://digs.fm</a>.<p>I'd appreciate any feedback, thanks in advance!<p>---------<p>EDIT: I figured it's worth expanding a bit on some highlights:<p>- In the search box, apart from searching, you can copy/paste any release URL from Discogs/Spotify/Bandcamp/Mixcloud/MusicBrainz and it will basically fetch the release and then you can add it to your lists.<p>- There are browser extensions for Firefox and Chrome, so that when you're on some of the aforementioned sites, and you stumbled upon an interesting album, you can click the extension icon and the item will be added to your &quot;Want to Listen&quot; list.<p>- For certain releases, you'll notice there's an embedded web player, for convenience.",
