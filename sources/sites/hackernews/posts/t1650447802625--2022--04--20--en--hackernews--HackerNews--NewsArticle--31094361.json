  "description": "Hi HN!<p>I am looking to buy a laptop for software development in the 0 to $2000 (USD) range.<p>What I am looking for:\n1. Durability: battery life is important to me as well as general longevity of the hardware i.e. I would like it to last a long time.<p>2. Linux support: I use Linux as my OS of choice and I have <i>no</i> intention of using Windows/MacOS<p>3. Optimized for intensive computing usage.<p>Other things of note:<p>I looked into the Framework laptops and so far it looks like they are still a bit beta.<p>However, I <i>am</i> curious about users' experiences with:<p>* the KDE Slimbook 15: https://slimbook.es/en/store/slimbook-kde/kde-slimbook-15-comprar<p>* the Purism Librem 14: https://puri.sm/products/librem-14/<p>* Kubuntu Focus: https://kfocus.org/order/order-m2.html<p>* the StarBook 14-inch – Star Labs®: https://starlabs.systems/pages/starbook<p>Also tips about maintaining battery life would be appreciated. I've read too much conflicting advice about that lately :) Thanks.",
