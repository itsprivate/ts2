  "description": "Hi HN! founder of nat.app here.<p>I've seen so many people building personal CRMs over the past years. Somehow, they all seemed to fail and die a year or two in.<p>The main reason for this in my opinion is that the personal CRM business is a bad business. People <i>sort of</i> want this and will tweet about in from time to time, but only very few people are willing to pay and put in the effort (aka. reaching back out to people), to make it work.<p>Those very few people are our market and because it's a small market, there is no way to sustain such a business unless you're bootstrapped and working on this part time (which we are).<p>Our approach is very specific: We focus on Google users (which is why there is only a Google login) who communicate mainly through email and put every IRL meeting in their calendar.<p>For those people, we are able to capture 80% of their social interactions with Google's APIs. Which means that our <i>if-else rules</i> are accurately able to identify contacts our customers are losing touch with.<p>nat.app then acts as a safety net and displays those contacts to our customers.<p>This product really has been a labor of love over the past 3 years and I'm very happy to be sharing it with you today.",
