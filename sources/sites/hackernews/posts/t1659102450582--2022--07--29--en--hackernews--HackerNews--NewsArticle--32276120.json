New logo, new domain, what could go wrong.<p>We provide a tool to convert design files between Figma, XD, Sketch, Figma, PDF and more and have recently rebranded it from &quot;XD2Sketch&quot; to &quot;Magicul&quot;. We started out as a simple tool to allow users to import XD files in Sketch hence the name XD2Sketch but soon added more features. The name just didn't make sense anymore. Magicul initially seemed to be a great name, but turned out to be a bit of an interesting pick when translated to French.<p>We've sent out a newsletter to our customers to let them know about the changes and here's what one of our users replied:<p><i>Hey folks,<p>While I understand that you guys probably hope to operate primarily in English, I think it needs to be mentioned that your brand name &quot;Magicul&quot; in french, literally means &quot;Magical ass&quot;... but the real kicker is the .io of the domain, which literally means input &amp; output...<p>So here goes the bad news...
