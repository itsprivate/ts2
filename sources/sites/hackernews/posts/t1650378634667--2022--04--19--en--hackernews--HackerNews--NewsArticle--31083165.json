  "description": "So, let me preface this by saying that I think it's possible to have a healthy discussion on this topic, and I am not trying to be overly judgmental of Substack.<p>But, I am genuinely curious why is it getting so popular and particularly here on Hacker News. Does it have some kind of a hidden feature that makes it very appealing?<p>My number one assumption would be that it uses a global userbase, so people who write on Substack can collect subscribers/readers much faster. Is that all there is to it?<p>I also know that Substack prefetches an email address (once you enter it on any Substack-based site) and then plasters it on all their other customer sites, which I _really_ <i>hate</i> about their platform.<p>But I can see the appeal in that, I guess.",
