  "description": "Hi HN,<p>Three months ago, I took a job at Baseten to help craft and document an application builder that lets data scientists build full-stack, production-ready applications around their ML models without worrying about containers, Flask, or React. From my first day, everyone was focused on what would happen today: opening up our public beta. I’m super excited to see what you build with Baseten.<p>If you want to take Baseten for a full-speed test drive, follow along with this tutorial, where you can build and deploy an application in 20 minutes: <a href=\"https://docs.baseten.co/getting-started\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.baseten.co/getting-started</a><p>While Baseten is built for data scientists and machine learning engineers, something I’m particularly excited about that doesn’t come up often when we talk about Baseten is how it also makes building with ML available to people like me with a general software engineering background but no real experience with ML. With our library of pre-trained models, you can build and deploy an application around models for tasks like sentiment analysis, image classification, and speech transcription. By building applications around pre-trained models, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of the use cases, capabilities, and limitations of machine learning.<p>If you want to play around with some models and applications without signing up for an account yet, check out our gallery (<a href=\"https://baseten.co/gallery\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://baseten.co/gallery</a>) and try the demo apps.<p>P.S. We are also hiring; I found Baseten from HN.",
