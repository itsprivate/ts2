However it has had some reliability problems with a key, and eventually with the USB cable. The Korg is incredibly tiny, cute, and works fine ... but the keys are just buttons. Ideal for carrying around with an iPad, though, cheap, and so far reliable.<p>So I need to replace the Xkey 25. What other highly portable keyboards have people enjoyed using?
