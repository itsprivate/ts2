  "description": "Hello there. I am a high school senior and am interested in computer programming and linux system administration.\nSometimes I like to check the internship section on hiring positions available in the monthly _Who's hiring_ post.<p>But every internship has certain specifications which usually include (at least) 4th semester of an undergraduate degree, etc. As you may imagine, I am yet to be in that position. I will be starting a CS Engineer Degree in the Fall of 2022, but I would be quite interested in gaining some experience from any Computer Science real workplace worlds.<p>I am looking for suggestions on how to start looking for these kinds of internships, from what I've been looking online I haven't really found anything relevant. I'd be open for any positions (physically) near Mexico City and/or virtually with international companies or even US! (I am a US citizen if that matters).<p>I am not (currently) living in the United States. I was raised and born there for four years but all my education has been in Mexico, near Mexico City.<p>If you'd like some tldr'd CV it's:<p>- Highschool PrepaTec Toluca - Tec de Monterrey. 2019-2022<p>- Local Robotics Highschool team. Known as TECBOT [0]. I currently lead the teaching of rookies for the programming area and have been on the team since 2019 (since the end of middle school).<p><pre><code>  - tecbot github: [4]</code></pre>\n- Github: [1] trevcan.\n- Self-hosted server website: [2]<p><pre><code>  - I have a blog @ `/blog`, and a \n\n  - git server @ [3]</code></pre>\n- I'll be starting a CS engineering degree in the fall of 2022 at Tec de Monterrey Campus Toluca (a.k.a. ITESM, near Mexico City).\n- English. Almost native. Latest score: C1 (made less than six months ago).<p>- Also speak native Spanish.<p>References:<p>[0] https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/3158<p>[1] https://github.com/trevcan<p>[2] https://trevcan.duckdns.org/<p>[3] https://git-trevcan.duckdns.org/<p>[4] https://github.com/tecbot3158<p>Thanks for your time.",
