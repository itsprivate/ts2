  "description": "I want to be able to spin up a Windows GUI in my browser. A box that I can interact with, without it being 'headless' or CLI only. I Googled for this, but got no results. Most results were offering CLI-only Linux distros. I want to be able to surf the web, listen to music, etc<p>I'm willing to pay $5.00/mo to have my own cloud based Windows installation that I can power on and also destroy it afterwards when I've finished a project.<p>Furthermore, I want this because I want to be more productive by separating machines, so I can focus on just one task. For example, an OS that is tailored <i>just</i> for coding only would be nice, instead of having one device that I use for <i>every</i> aspect of my daily computing.<p>Privacy/Anonymity is not my concern. I won't be doing anything sensitive in this OS.<p>Any suggestions?<p>(I've looked into Apache Guacamole &amp; VNC BTW. Didn't like them).",
