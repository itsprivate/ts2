  "description": "I want to use Google Cloud for a project, but I keep seeing articles on HN reporting cases where Google has terminated a customer with no recourse or investigation. Taken together, the articles allege the following:<p>1. Google may directly ban your business account without stating a reason, leaving you helpless and bewildered[0][1][2].<p>2. Google will ban all accounts it believes are associated with an account it is banning, implying that anyone who is associated with your business can get it banned by doing things on their own[3], whether that means breaking Google's TOS or being unlucky (see point 1).<p>3. Competitors can shut your business down by organizing click fraud that appears to benefit you[4], and there's nothing you can do to stop it.<p>Because I actually <i>like</i> GCP, I am willing to consider the other side too. Arguments counter to the obvious implications of the above are,<p>1. Amazon and Microsoft have an incentive to cast doubt on Google's reliability as a provider, and maybe Jeffrey Bezos is making all of these HN posts from his yacht. More realistically, I know that I am not getting an unbiased sample by only reading the stories that get a lot of upvotes.<p>2. These injustices may be so rare that they don't factor in to anyone's risk analysis, but rather strike like meteors. Nobody wears a bike helmet for them, although they have hit people in the head before.<p>3. Someone who got banned for cause would naturally want to try getting themselves un-banned by waging a Twitter campaign, but this naturally raises the question of why this only happens with Google.<p>I know that a lot of posters here have performed a serious risk analysis in the course of their own jobs. I have read comment threads decrying the individual incidents, but never one looking at it from the perspective of what a business should actually choose. Hopefully, that is what we can do here.<p>[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25899814<p>[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30823872<p>[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26390833<p>[3] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30855065<p>[4] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26965146",
