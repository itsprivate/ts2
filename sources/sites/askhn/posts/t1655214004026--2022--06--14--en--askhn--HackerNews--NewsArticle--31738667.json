And it appears to be true, but then I look back at what I've learned and it's &quot;not much&quot;, but I've looked at what I've lost and it's so much: stopped going to the gym, stopped playing my instruments, stopped going to the conservatory, and now I'm only formally enrolled in University but haven't studied in a while.<p>I've tried two years of therapy with 5 different therapists and, sincerely, I've no more money and time to waste in such unfruitful ways. I'm fairly certain that I'm depressed, but where the causation lies: it came first the depression or the Intenet addiction? All I can remember is that these kind of tribulation started onw or two years after I was &quot;plugged&quot;.<p>I'm becoming my worst nightmare, an unsuccessful NEET with a shadow of his former self and intelligence, with no identity anymore. I wish I could just unplug it all: I love the times when we have a blackout or when I go visiting my father without internet connection: I read for more than <i>3 minutes</i>, I relax and <i>without watching youtube</i>. Internet addiction and depression are feeding each other, both symptoms of my malaise and dissatisfaction with my life: the addictive activity promises to be the cure to the problem that itself has caused.",
