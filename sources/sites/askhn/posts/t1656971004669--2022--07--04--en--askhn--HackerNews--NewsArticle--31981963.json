  "description": "Someone was asking how to determine the quality of coding practices at places they are interviewing. My mind went on a tangent wondering if it is fair for interviewees to bring a coding exercise for the interviewers to complete. I've heard that interviews are an opportunity for both sides to interview each other? So does the interviewee have an equal opportunity to determine how the interviewers work through problems by presenting their own exercise for the interviewers to complete, and therefore gain insight on the company's practices?<p>I've never heard of anyone doing this before and I don't think it would be well received. Has anyone done this? For anyone who conducts interviews what would you think if someone did this?",
