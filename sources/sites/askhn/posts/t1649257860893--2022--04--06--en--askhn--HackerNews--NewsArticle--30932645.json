  "description": "I often feel anxiety for a specific reason. For example, when I have an appointment with a dentist, it will negatively impact my quality of life for several days. The days <i>before</i> the appointment. During these days, I cannot really focus on other things as much as I like.<p>It is not as if I feel terribly anxious. Just kinda constantly restless. And not really able to enjoy life. I constantly think &quot;Ok, I need to get over this appointment first. Then I can live my life again.&quot;.<p>Are there techniques to deal with this?",
