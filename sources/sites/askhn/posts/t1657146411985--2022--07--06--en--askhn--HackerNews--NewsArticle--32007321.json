  "description": "I’m looking for a wife. I’ve basically lost all drive these last few months to go solo. I quit my job and started traveling with the intention of moving to NYC after I'm done traveling solely to find a partner. The stock market crash on growth stocks definitely hasn’t helped my enthusiasm here as it looks like I’m grinding <i>alone</i> for <i>another</i> decade. How does one go about finding a high earning partner? It doesn’t have to be in tech - I’m open to law, medicine, finance, etc. I’m looking for someone who is earning similar FAANG comp but I have no idea where to find these people. It seems like online dating has them <i>but</i> I’m not physically attractive enough for online dating. I don’t know if that’s a market I can actually get through to but I feel it’s my only real option. At this point - I’m thinking of forking over $50k on image consultation, photos, personal training, and surgery to get me closer. I have already had surgery but it seemed to be inconsequential - so, I am not optimistic here.<p>I’m practically ready to settle for someone who wears a bag over their face and is a mute in order to just get by in life as long as they can pay the bills but I can’t even find that. Where do these people exist? How do you find a high earning partner <i>who is single</i>? I’ve found many that aren’t single but none that are.<p>I’m also wanting kids and I’m totally willing to be a SAHP. If mommy wants to play corporate wargames, be my guest. I’ll even pay for a surrogate if she’s worried about pregnancy woes! (Please get me out of corporate wargames!)<p>I suspect many of you - like most of my peers - met your partner in college, grad school, or very shortly thereafter. For those who didn't though (and in the last five years preferably since the dating market has changed drastically in the last 5-10 years) - any tips?",
