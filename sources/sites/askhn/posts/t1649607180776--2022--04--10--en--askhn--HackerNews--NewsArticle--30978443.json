  "description": "During Coinbase signup, it prompted me to provide ACH details. This makes sense -- an easy way to convert fiat currency to/from cryptocurrency.<p>However, then they wanted me to sign in to my bank account using Plaid. When I said that I didn't want to do Plaid and just provide regular ACH details (routing/ABA and acct number), the system forced a dark pattern and immediately switched back to Plaid login as soon as I entered the routing number (111000025 is Bank of America's routing number.)<p>As I understand it, Plaid uses your bank login to grab your checking account history (all transactions) as well as sharing this information with Coinbase. Why does Coinbase <i>force</i> this requirement, but only for banks that it knows it can gain access to this data for? What if I switch to a local community bank?<p>It doesn't seem that this level of checking detail is required by law in any country, even for KYC, so why does Coinbase want access to this information that isn't required for KYC compliance?<p>Are there other exchanges that are more customer friendly?",
