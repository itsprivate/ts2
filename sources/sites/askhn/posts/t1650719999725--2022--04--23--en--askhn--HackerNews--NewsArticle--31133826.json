  "description": "I'm embarking on a very ambitious project led by a particular vision of mine [0], something I've worked hard to flesh out over the past 2+ years (the entire process probably going back 10+ years).<p>Despite being quite confident about my vision, it's becoming increasingly clear to me that the very act of pursuing one's own unique vision comes with its own set of challenges, namely:<p>- general lack of guidance and trying to figure out everything myself<p>- self-doubt and dealing with criticisms, failures, disappointment<p>- struggle staying motivated and maintaining progress over a long time frame<p>- staying true to my vision, while making sure to be open-minded to feedback<p>- navigating big shifts in direction, re-evaluating the vision itself<p>- feeling isolated/alone because no one else <i>really</i> understands what I'm trying to do<p>I understand this is a big cloud of questions to tackle, but if anyone has anything at all to contribute to these (or other) aspects of pursuing one's own vision, I would really appreciate it!<p>Thanks so much in advance!<p>[0]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30976504",
