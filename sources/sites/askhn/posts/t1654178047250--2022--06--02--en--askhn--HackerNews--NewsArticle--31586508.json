  "description": "I recently started working at a new company and one of the other devs routinely submits changes for review that are 1 diff with 1k-5k lines changed.<p>At my last company the culture was to break up work into easily understood chunks, so the same code would have probably been 5-10 diffs of 100-1000 lines each. I thought it really helped make reviews much more effective and quicker. It took practice to learn how to effectively break up my changes like this but now I can't imagine doing it any other way.<p>I find it impossible to truly understand whats going on when looking at a set of changes that are bigger than around 1000 lines (not including unit tests.) Apparently people block out 2-3 hour chunks on their calendar to review this person's code.<p>Is it reasonable to ask this person to break up their work so its easier to review, or am I the outlier and should I just try to get better at reading and reviewing very large diffs?",
