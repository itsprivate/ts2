  "description": "In a recent interview around culture fit, I got a feeling that the interviewer had some agenda against me.<p>I was frequently cut mid sentences, without me being able to build the complete context, and was asked to drill into a negative aspect of the answer.<p>My answers were frequently negated, with interviewer simply stating- “i think here you are wrong and this could be changed”. Upon asking what or how, the reply was - some random philosophy and with the onto the next question.<p>I lost my temper, and to no surprise wasn’t able to move forward in the interview.<p>I might have read the signs wrong, but, I got a feeling that interviewer really got something against me.<p>How to navigate such a situation? Have you ever faces such a situation and were you able to navigate that discussion in your own favor?",
