  "description": "While home-buying I was bombarded with dozens of introductions to strangers asking me to wire large sums of money and share sensitive personal information, typically via email.  The emails themselves were suspicious – from dubious domains, lacking signatures – few if any signals to trust the individual.<p>To establish trust I asked them to Facetime and share IDs mutually, but they balked.  I've tried this before and people are generally reluctant.  Asking for a mutual phone call with a trusted person was also met with suspicion.<p>Ultimately, I met the escrow agents and sellers face-to-face at their business to collect business cards and transfer information.  There's still no better authentication than meeting a person at their place of business: they have business cards, an office, co-workers – half a dozen signals to verify identity.<p>Despite the high incidence of wire fraud and identity theft, authentication protocols are all one-sided.  Customers require credentials but there's no way to authenticate the business agents. This goes beyond banking to include healthcare, utilities, credit bureaus, the tax industry – any business relationship that  shares sensitive or personal info.<p><i>tl;dr</i> :<p>So, how do you go about establishing trust with strangers in order to share sensitive information or transfer money? What process and / or tech do you use to identify &amp; trust the other side of the transaction?<p><i>My Proposal</i> :<p>On the social side, we need to improve the culture of verifying identity to encourage a mutual process.  Both sides need to share IDs and proofs of identity for any transaction to be sound.<p>As for technology, we need better systems to empower customers to validate the authenticity of agents, including one-time tokens and business verification.  A system like &quot;The Work Number&quot;, used for employee verification, could be effective to validate business agents without compromising them. These systems need to be stable over legacy channels like phone, fax, wire transfers, paper checks &amp; email – systems that will remain for 30+ years.<p>As software engineers we need to establish trust mutually and give more attention to the business-side of the trust relationship.",
