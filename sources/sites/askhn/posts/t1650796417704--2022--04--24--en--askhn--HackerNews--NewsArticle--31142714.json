  "description": "A few others commented on a recent thread [0] mentioning that they no longer browse the the internet, and that the internet &quot;forgot how to let itself become browsed&quot;.<p>This really got me thinking about this whole phenomenon. Of proliferation of &quot;walled-gardens&quot;, of search engines like Chrome becoming less effective due to SEO optimization and thus users having to look elsewhere, whether that's Reddit, Quora, HN, etc.<p>Obviously, we all still occasionally browse the web, but it really doesn't compare to back in the days, at least for me.<p>What's happened to the web??? How much is because of shifts in technology, and how much is because of a <i>cultural</i> shift, of how we use the web, of the type of information we seek (eg preferring people-mediated information like Reddit/Quora/HN, rather than static information sources like a website dedicated to a topic)?<p>Maybe this isn't necessary bad thing? Or is it? If we could dream up a different search environment and different technologies surrounding the internet and the WWW, what would it be?<p>[0]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31111394#31114748",
