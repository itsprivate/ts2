  "description": "Is there a users guide available? I am well versed in Social Media Sites, but even so I find the lack of intuitivity cumbersome. A flow chart would be helpful as would a video presentation of how to use the site.<p>So far this site has been “All sizzle and no steak” and by that, to me it seems to have all the intimacy of being one of many at a virtual rally instead of mirroring the experience of attending one live where you can share information with people that you can make soft contact with. I am following 1000 people, strangers all, because there is no way to search for and find any of my contacts. As for it not being censored I understand that it is in fear that Apple will remove their APP.<p>Would reproraming it be an option?",
