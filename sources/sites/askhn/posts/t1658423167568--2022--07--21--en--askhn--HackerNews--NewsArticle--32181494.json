  "description": "I've been working at this company for ~4 months, and I feel like an absolute outcast there. I work 3/5 days remotely, and I'm pretty happy when I work by myself—the job is fine. The problem comes with the two days I need to go to the office. I've anxiety the night before, and I feel depressed the day after.<p>My coworkers have a cliquey vibe, and I feel like the weird introvert who doesn't talk very much. I do talk with people I feel comfortable with, but with this team (I don't know why) I enter <i>quiet mode</i>, and I can't go out of there. It's weird because it's the first time at a job that I don't click with anybody. In previous experiences, I always have had 2 or 3 coworkers which whom I could get along with, make jokes, or share some kind of interest.<p>Here I don't have anybody to share a problem with. It makes me feel sad, and I'm falling into a depression. I know that we don't go to work to make friends, but I'm experiencing first-hand time how difficult it is the lack of support at the workplace.<p>I thought that waiting some time would make things better, but they are going worse. I'm avoiding going to breakfast with them, to keep away from the weird silences, and I feel like I do them a favour (if I go with them I sit there without saying anything).<p>What should I do? I'm thinking of quitting, but I'm not sure if I'm being too drastic.",
