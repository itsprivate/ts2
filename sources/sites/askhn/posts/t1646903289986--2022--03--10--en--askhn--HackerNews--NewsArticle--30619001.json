  "description": "(Excuse my noobness, please.)<p>Hi, I think you already know that when you click on the post link of a story, all stories from that top level domain appears.<p>If there is a video from YouTube, then, if I click on<p><pre><code>    (youtube.com)\n</code></pre>\n, then all posts having YouTube as a top level domain appears as result.<p>The API call looks like<p><pre><code>    from?site=YouTube.com\n</code></pre>\nBut this is always sorted based on time of posting. Can this be changed?<p>Say, I want to see all stories from New Yorker, ranked based on votes those stories received, what do I do?<p>I know this part-<p><pre><code>    https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=newyorker.com\n</code></pre>\nBut what more do I add to rank the result based on number of votes?<p>Or is there a completely different way to do this?",
