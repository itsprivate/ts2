I ran into this problem at https://criya.co. Criyas customers are mostly interior designers, doing projects for clients. An interior designer needed to be able to upload <i>their</i> contract, and collect a signature from the client before engaging in a design project together.<p>Because I’m not a lawyer, I was hoping to be able to buy instead of build. When I looked around for products in this space, the closest I could find were products that let <i>the company</i> upload documents, add signature fields, and embed them in app. Sure, we could've told people they had to use <i>our</i> standard contract, but that would’ve been awkward, and the interior designers would probably have just gone off platform for signatures.<p>There doesn't appear to be anything on the market that lets the <i>end user</i> upload documents, mark them up with signature fields, and require other people to sign them, before programmatically doing other things.<p>After some hacking, here is what I came up with: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1wdKyB8Mdg&amp;t=0s.<p>I'm packaging this up as a bunch of react hooks &amp; components, so engineering teams can maintain control of the UI, making the integration feel exactly like the rest of your product. I'm a big fan of companies like https://clerk.dev or https://typesense.org that give me full stack features with mainly front end integrations.<p>I think we are going to see a big wave of 'embedded SaaS' products in the coming years. You can send a HMAC Digest[1] to a browser, and use that for authentication with an external service, it's cool!<p>I've started onboarding a couple companies, and am trying to talk to as many devs as possible. Would love to hear from the HN community, feel free to 'request access' on my marketing site (https://scribble.run), or drop me a line (andrew at scribble dot run)!<p>[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC",
