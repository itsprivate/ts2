  "description": "Ask HN: I was wondering if there is VC appetite for defense based tech companies.<p>We are in advanced talks (hence the throw away) with M&amp;A teams of various of the top defense contractors for our startup, but me as CTO can't help but wonder if a VC model for us going forward wouldn't also be a good fit. Traditionally VC's shied away from hardware and defense startups but with the funding round of Anduril perhaps this is changing.<p>Katherine Boyle of A16Z also had something to say about how VC investment and Defense in the past didn't make sense, but that things could be changing [1].<p>The second problem with VC's is it is notoriously difficult to get in contact with the correct person, thus the proposal below. Dang let me know if this is not allowed please.<p>If there are any VC's perhaps interested you can contact me here<p>throwawaydefence at gmail dot com<p>and I can send you our prospectus / NDA agreement.<p>[1] - https://www.defensenews.com/smr/cultural-clash/2020/01/30/the-math-doesnt-make-sense-why-venture-capital-firms-are-wary-of-defense-focused-investments/<p>Edit - To address some of the comments below, this is a well established team (~50), with a proven track record, many years in the industry and a well developed sales pipeline, relationships and technology base.<p>So not just an idea or proposal thing, startup was maybe the wrong characterization but since this is HN...<p>The deal is (I believe) well above the typical SBIR grants threshold.",
